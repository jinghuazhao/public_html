Welcome! This page is `user/pages/01.home/default.md` by a [Markdown](http://learn.getgrav.org/content/markdown) [editor](http://learn.getgrav.org/basics/requirements). New pages are added easily by these steps:

1. Navigate to `user/pages/` and create a new folder named `03.mypage` using [explicit default ordering](http://learn.getgrav.org/content/content-pages).
2. Launch a text editor and paste in the following sample code:

        ---
        title: My New Page
        ---
        # My New Page!

        This is the body of **my new page** which accepts _Markdown_ syntax.

3. Save this file as `user/pages/03.mypage/default.md` to render the page using the **default** template.
4. Reload browser to see new page in the menu. To rename the menu item, add: `menu: My Page` between the dashes (the YAML front matter) for page-specific options.
