planning and implementation, we are able to furnish a timely analysis of our 
large project. Our primary interest here is not a detailed account of the 
hardware and timing for our project but the approach we implement. We have 
focused on single-point analysis, and the problem can be more complex when 
multipoint analysis is involved.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3" face="Arial">Our approach builds on our considerable experiences of the 
computer systems over years. Given that the SAS system is widely available, our 
work will be welcome. We also noted some caveats association with SAS. While the 
system was designed to<st1:personname

procedures is heterogeneous. For instance, we noted in general, PROC SQL is

and can perform more sophisticated data management tasks. We do not necessarily 
need to segment the data in order to use PROCs MEANS and FREQ. On the other

       han</st1:personname>d, the SAS/GENETICS procedures 
often run into memory problems, but fortunately SAS has many alternative ways to 
do the same task. As the usage of disk space is quite heavy, it will be more 
useful to enable SAS/GENETICS procedures to read phenotype data separately. Over 
years SAS language has been enriched but relatively stable and its powerful 
macro facility is also an extra advantage to many other software systems. We are 
yet to develop into other types of analysis available, e.g., principal component 
analysis and partial least squares method for structured association, cluster 
analysis for study of relatedness and outliers, covariance structure modelling 
for pathway analysis, just to name a few.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3" face="Arial">The software we 
developed is largely applicable to those with moderate resources and both Linux 
and Windows systems. We have also started and will continue our experiments on 
other software systems including Stata (</font><a 
href="http://www.stata.com/"><font size="3" face="Arial">http://www.stata.com</font></a><font 
size=3 face=Arial>), R (</font><a href="http://www.r-project.org/"><font 
size=3 face=Arial>http://www.r-project.org</font></a><font size="3" face="Arial">), standalone programs 
such as SNPGWA (</font><a 
href="http://www.phs.wfubmc.edu/web/public_bios/sec_gene/downloads.cfm"><font 
size=3 face=Arial>http://www.phs.wfubmc.edu/web/public_bios/sec_gene/downloads.cfm</font></a><font 
size=3 face=Arial>), and commercial software such as BC/SNPmax (</font><a 
href="http://www.bcplatforms.com/"><font 
size=3 face=Arial>http://www.bcplatforms.com</font></a><font size="3" face="Arial">). In general, grid 
computing using clusters is now the state-of-the-art alternative to 
supercomputers, which is well-documented and will be part of our next 
experiment. SAS, Stata, R all have facilities to support multiple processors. 
They are also generic and not specific to genetic data. An additional feature 
common to these system is the support of open database connectivity which allows 
for synchronous access to databases. The comparison of these systems however 
will be more appropriate in a separate contribution.</font></p>
