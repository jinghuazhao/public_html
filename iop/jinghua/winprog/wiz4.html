<!-- Force all text to format --><FONT FACE="arial">Probably the
best way to understand the document and view classes, as well
as the ClassWizard and resource editors, is to run through a simple
example application that makes use of all of these features in
straightforward ways. In this tutorial we will use the AppWizard
framework that you generated in the previous tutorial. As you
recall, we modified it so that you could draw small rectangles
using the mouse. However, it has no way to load or save the &quot;drawings&quot;,
nor can it refresh the screen on exposure. In this tutorial we
will solve these problems using the Document/View paradigm. We
will also add a new menu option and dialog to the application
to demonstrate simple uses of the resource editors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Start with the &quot;samp&quot; application
framework that you created in tutorial 3. In order to turn this
framework into a complete application we must take the following
steps:</FONT></P>

<OL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Add a data structure to the document class
  to hold the points that the user draws.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Add code to the document class so that
  the data structure in the document class is properly loaded from
  and saved to disk.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Add code to the view class so that whenever
  the user draws a point it is added to the document's data structure.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Add code to the view class so that it
  properly redraws the drawing when the application receives an
  exposure event.</FONT>
</OL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Altogether, we will have to write only about
15 lines of code to accomplish all of this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The following instructions walk you through
these different steps.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 1: Add a data structure to the document
class</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">MFC contains a variety of different collection
classes, and by using them we can very easily add a robust data
structure to hold the points that the user draws. Look up the
collection classes in the MFC help file by choosing the <B>Search</B>
option in the <B>Help</B> menu, and then typing &quot;hierarchy
chart&quot;. There should be a category toward the right of the
chart with Arrays, Lists and Maps. These are the collection classes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In this application we need to store the
points drawn by the user. This is most easily done using a pair
of <B>CDWordArrays</B>. These are simple array classes that store
values of type <B>DWORD </B>(a DWORD being a 32-bit signed integer),
and we will store the x value of each point in one of the arrays
and the y value of each point in the other. Click on the CDwordArray
class in the hierarchy chart to learn more about the class. The
MFC array classes have a number of useful features that will make
our lives easier: The MFC arrays automatically size themselves
as new elements are added and give you virtually infinite room,
they do range checking in debug mode, and they know how to read
and write themselves to disk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Open the SAMPDOC.H file (probably the easiest
way to do this is to double click on the CSampDoc class in the
ClassView seen in tutorial 3, or go to the FileView and double
click on SAMPDOC.H in the Header Files folder) and find the public
attributes section. There will be a section labeled &quot;//attributes&quot;
with a &quot;public:&quot; marker within it. In that position
type:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">CDWordArray x, y;</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">If you then save the header file, the ClassView
of the project window will display the two new variables in the
CSampDoc class.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">As an alternative, you can use the tools.
Right-click on CSampDoc in the ClassView, and then choose <B>Add
Member Variable...</B> from the list. You will have to do this
twice, once for x and once for y. Both variables will be added
to the public implementation section of the header file, and you
can watch it happen if you have the header file open. For now,
put x and y in the attributes section.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In this simple example we will treat the
arrays as public members to make things more obvious, but in a
real application it would be beneficial to make the data structure
private and provide new member functions in the document class
to allow the manipulation of the data structure. These functions
would allow for the complete encapsulation of the document class.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 2: Allow for loading and saving of
the document's data structure</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The AppWizard framework and the MFC classes
do a good bit of the work related to loading and saving files
to disk. For example, when you choose the <B>Open</B> option of
the <B>File</B> menu in your drawing program, it already pulls
up the proper File Open dialog. The framework then takes the file
name selected by the user, opens it, creates a binary &quot;archive&quot;
and attaches it to that file, calls several functions in the <B>CDocument</B>
class, and finally calls a function named <B>Serialize</B> in
the CSampDoc class, passing it the archive (to see all of this
code in action, finish adding the code described in this tutorial
and put a break point in the document's <B>Serialize</B> function,
run the program under the debugger, choose File Open, and then,
when the program stops, choose the <B>Call Stack</B> option in
the <B>View</B> menu. You will be able to examine the MFC source
code). This same <B>Serialize</B> function is also called when
it is time to save the file. All that you have to do is fill in
this function and your data structure will automatically be loaded
and saved to disk. To make matters even easier, the <B>CDWordArray
</B>class (and all other MFC collection classes) know how to serialize
themselves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Find the <B>Serialize</B> function in the
CSampDoc class. The easiest was to do this is to open the ClassView,
click on plus sign next to CSampDoc, and then double click on
the Serialize function. Change it so that it looks like this:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">void CSampDoc::Serialize(CArchive&amp; ar)</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">{</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    x.Serialize(ar);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    y.Serialize(ar);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">}</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> variables will
handle all details of serialization, including understanding whether
they should load or save themselves to the archive. The archive
knows which direction the data should move.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 3: Modify the view class so it saves
points into the document's data structure</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">First we will add a member variable to the
view class to store the size of the rectangles that the editor
draws, rather than using the hard-coded value of 5 as in tutorial
3. We will then later add a dialog that lets us change this value
in order to demonstrate the addition of dialogs. Open SAMPVIEW.H
and find the public attributes section. Add the following declaration:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">int w;</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Note that in this same section the view
has a member function named <B>GetDocument</B> that returns a
pointer back to the view's document. This function will be important
in a moment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now find the constructor for the CSampView
class (you can double-click on it in the ClassView and add the
following line to initialize the new member:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">w = 5;</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In the CSampView class, find the <B>OnMouseMove</B>
function that you added in tutorial 3 (you can find it by hand
in SAMPVIEW.CPP, or use the ClassView). Change the function so
that it looks like this:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">void CSampView::OnMouseMove(UINT nFlags, CPoint point) </FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">{</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    CSampDoc* pDoc = GetDocument();</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    ASSERT_VALID(pDoc);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    if (nFlags == MK_LBUTTON)</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    {</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">        CClientDC dc(this);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">        dc.Rectangle(point.x, point.y, </FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">            point.x+w, point.y+w);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">        pDoc-&gt;x.Add(point.x);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">        pDoc-&gt;y.Add(point.y);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">        pDoc-&gt;SetModifiedFlag();</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">	}</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    CView::OnMouseMove(nFlags, point);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">}</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Look up <B>OnMouseMove</B> in the MFC help
file for information on its parameters. The easiest way to do
this is to select Search in the Help menu and type OnMouseMove.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The function has been modified so that it
retrieves a pointer to the view's document and then saves the
current point in the document's <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> members.
The function also calls the document's <B>SetModifiedFlag</B>
function (see the MFC help file) to set the document's dirty bit.
Once set, the document will automatically query the user about
saving the file if the user attempts to close it or quit without
saving. This function also makes use of the new <B>w</B> member
in the view.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 4: Handle exposure events in the view
class</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Whenever the view class receives an exposure
(WM_PAINT) event, it calls the <B>OnDraw</B> member function.
This function also is called to handle printing. By putting exposure-handling
code into this function you can complete the application. Find
the <B>OnDraw</B> function in the CSampView class. Modify it as
shown below:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">void CSampView::OnDraw(CDC* pDC)</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">{</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    CSampDoc* pDoc = GetDocument();</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    ASSERT_VALID(pDoc);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    int i;</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    for (i=0; i&lt;pDoc-&gt;x.GetSize(); i++)</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">        pDC-&gt;Rectangle(pDoc-&gt;x[i],</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">            pDoc-&gt;y[i],</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">            pDoc-&gt;x[i]+w,</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">            pDoc-&gt;y[i]+w);</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">}</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">This function simply asks one of the arrays
how many elements it contains and then runs through a <B>for</B>
loop that many times, drawing all of the points that the user
has previously entered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Compile and run the application. You will
find that it properly handles exposure events, and that it can
now load and save files to disk. You have properly modified the
document and view classes to create a complete, fully functional
drawing editor. Congratulations!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Note that, as described in tutorial 3, the
document class holds the data structure and loads and saves the
data to disk. The view class uses the data in the document to
handle redrawing, and manipulates the data when the user moves
the mouse. This is proper use of the document and view classes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">It would not be a bad idea to now stop,
close this tutorial, and try to recreate the application &quot;blind&quot;.
You will find that you generate a number of questions when you
try to do it without help, and those questions can teach you a
lot.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">What we would like to do now is add a new
menu option and dialog to the application so that the user can
modify the size of the rectangles that the application draws.
This exercise will show you how easy it is to modify the menu
and create new dialog resources.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 5: Add a new menu option</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In the application's workspace window choose
the ResourceView tab and double click on the Menu resource section.
You will find that the application has two menus. Double click
on both and look at them. IDR_MAINFRAME is short, and is used
when there are no windows open in the MDI framework. IDR_SAMPTYPE
is longer and appears when windows are open. We want to modify
IDR_SAMPTYPE, so open it by double clicking on it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">At the end of the menu bar you will find
an empty rectangle. Click on it and type &quot;&amp;Option&quot;.
Press the Return key. The &amp; character indicates which letter
in the menu title you want to use as a mnemonic, and will appear
underlined when the menu is shown on the screen. You can move
the &amp; anywhere within the string. Now a new rectangle will
appear below <B>Option</B>. Click on it and type &quot;&amp;Size&quot;.
Press the Return key. Now click on <B>Option</B> and drag it to
a more appropriate place in the menu bar, perhaps between <B>Edit</B>
and <B>View</B>. That's all it takes to create a new menu and
option.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now double-click on the new size option.
Note that the editor has automatically assigned it the obvious
ID of ID_OPTION_SIZE. You can change the ID as you see fit, but
there is rarely a reason to do so. We will use this value inside
a message map to respond to the new option. [note: If you are
unfamiliar with the concept of a message map, visit the <A HREF="http://devcentral.iftech.com/learning/tutorials/mfc-win32/submfc.asp">MFC
Tutorials page</A> and see the introductory MFC tutorial]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Build and execute the application. You will
find that it has a new menu option but that the option is disabled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now open the ClassWizard by choosing the
<B>ClassWizard</B> option in the <B>View</B> menu. Make sure the
<B>Message Maps</B> tab is visible. Make sure the <B>CSampView</B>
class is selected. In the <B>Object IDs</B> list choose ID_OPTION_SIZE.
In the <B>Messages</B> list choose COMMAND (UPDATE_COMMAND_UI
is used primarily to enable and disable the menu options - look
up <B>CCmdUI </B>in the MFC help file for more information). Click
the <B>Add Function</B> button. The ClassWizard will pick the
obvious name <B>OnOptionsSize</B> for the new function and show
it to you. Click <B>OK</B> to accept the name. Click the <B>Edit
Code</B> button with the <B>OnOptionsSize</B> function selected
and modify the function as shown below:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">void CSampView::OnOptionsSize() </FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">{</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    Beep(500, 500);	</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">}</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Build and execute the application. Now when
you choose the <B>Size </B>option you will find that the application
beeps. You can see that it is trivial to wire new menu options
into an AppWizard application. </FONT><TABLE WIDTH="150" ALIGN="RIGHT"

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 6: Add a new dialog</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To add a new dialog to the application we
have to do four things:</FONT></P>

<OL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Create a new dialog template with the
  dialog resource editor,</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Create a new dialog class for that template,</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Add DDX variables(s) for the controls
  in the dialog, and</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">wire the dialog into the application.</FONT>
</OL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Here are the steps:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Select the <B>Resource...</B> option from
the <B>Insert</B> menu. Choose <B>Dialog</B> and click on <B>New</B>.
You should see a new dialog containing OK and Cancel buttons,
and a small palette of tools should also appear. If the palette
is not in evidence, choose the <B>Customize</B> option in the
<B>Tools</B> menu and check the box marked <B>Controls</B>. One
button on the palette says &quot;Aa&quot; and is used to create
static text controls. Another is labeled &quot;ab|&quot; and is
used to create editable text controls. Create a dialog that looks
like this:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><IMG SRC="dialog.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="288"
HEIGHT="120" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Click on the new edit control and press
<B>Enter</B>. You will find its ID to be IDC_EDIT1. This is fine
here, but in a real dialog you would likely change it to something
more meaningful. Select the OK button and note its ID is IDOK.
This is normal and you will not want to change it. Right click
in the title bar of the new dialog itself and choose the <B>Properties</B>
option. Note that the dialog's ID is IDD_DIALOG1. Note also that
you can change its title here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">With the dialog still open on the screen,
choose the <B>ClassWizard </B>option in the <B>View</B> menu.
The ClassWizard will see the new dialog and assume that your desire
is to create a new dialog class for it. This class will act as
a liaison between the dialog resource and your application, and
you will need to create a new dialog class for each dialog that
you add to an application (although you will rarely or never touch
this class except through the ClassWizard). The first dialog you
see lets you specify that you want to create a new dialog class.
There are several fields in the new dialog class creation dialog.
In the <B>Name</B> field type &quot;CSizeDlg&quot;. Make sure
that <B>Base Class</B> contains <B>CDialog</B>, that <B>File</B>
contains SIZEDLG.CPP, that the <B>Dialog ID</B> field contains
the dialog's ID of IDD_DIALOG1, and that <B>OLE Automation</B>
is set to None. Click the <B>OK</B> button to create the dialog
class. Click the <B>OK</B> button in the ClassWizard to close
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To try out the new dialog, Find the <B>OnOptionsSize</B>
function in the CSampView class. Change it so it appears as below:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">void CSampView::OnOptionsSize() </FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">{</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    CSizeDlg dlg;</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    dlg.DoModal();	</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">}</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Also, <I>be sure to include SIZEDLG.H as
the last header file included in SAMPVIEW.CPP.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Build and execute the application and select
the size option. You will find that the dialog appears properly
and disappears as expected when you click the OK or Cancel buttons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">What we would like to do now is get the
value typed by the user into the edit field so that we can modify
the view's <B>w</B> member. Select the <B>ClassWizard</B> option
in the <B>View </B>menu. Select the <B>Member Variables</B> tab
at the top of the ClassWizard. Make sure that <B>Class Name</B>
is set to <B>CSizeDlg </B>. We want to add a member variable to
the <B>CSizeDlg</B> class to allow us to get the value from the
dialog's edit control. In the list, double click on IDC_EDIT1.
In the dialog that appears, set the <B>Member Variable Name</B>
to &quot;m_size&quot;. Set the <B>Category</B> to &quot;Value&quot;.
Set the <B>Variable Type</B> to UINT. Click the OK button. In
the new <B>Minimum Value </B>and <B>Maximum Value</B> fields that
appear at the bottom of the ClassWizard type 2 and 50 respectively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The <B>m_size</B> variable is a <I>DDX</I>
variable. DDX=Dialog Data Exchange. This new variable will always
contain the value that the user types into the edit control, or
you can set it to display a default value to the user. The values
you typed for the minimum and maximum are known as <I>DDV</I>
values. DDV=Dialog Data Validation. Anything the user types will
be checked against these values when the user clicks the dialog's
OK button.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Replace the code in <B>OnOptionsSize</B>
with the following:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">void CSampView::OnOptionsSize() </FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">{</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    CSizeDlg dlg;</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    dlg.m_size = w;</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    if (dlg.DoModal() == IDOK)</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">        w = dlg.m_size;	</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">}</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Build and execute the program. You will
find that if you change the value in the dialog, the size of the
rectangles drawn by the application will change appropriately.
The code is simply setting or retrieving the value from the edit
control using the <B>m_size </B>variable as its proxy. The value
in <B>m_size</B> is copied into the edit control when the dialog
appears, and the value in the edit control is copied into <B>m_size</B>
when the user clicks the OK button.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You may notice that the edit control does
not initially have focus. Fix this by opening the dialog resource
