<BR>
<!-- Force all text to format --><FONT FACE="arial">The framework
that the AppWizard generates typically consists of at least 20
different files. The first time that you see those files and begin
to wade through them they can be extremely confusing unless you
have an appropriate roadmap. The purpose of this tutorial is to
provide you with that roadmap.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Let's start by creating a simple framework
with the AppWizard. To create this framework we will use all of
the default settings for the AppWizard's options. Once the AppWizard
has generated the files for this default framework we can go through
each one to see what they all do.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Select the <B>New</B> option in the <B>File</B>
menu. In the dialog that appears, make sure that the <B>Project</B>
tab is selected. We want to create an AppWizard workspace, so
select &quot;MFC AppWizard(exe)&quot; from the choices. Along
the right side of the window is a dialog that lets you name the
project, choose the project type, and pick the project's directory.
Choose the appropriate directory in which to create the new samp
directory by leaving it blank (a new directory will be created
in your current directory) or type the path directly. Name the
project &quot;samp&quot;. This name will be used as the new directory
name as well, and that is fine - you will see the word &quot;samp&quot;
echoed in the Location field as you type it. Click the <B>OK</B>
button to create the new project. </FONT><TABLE WIDTH="150" ALIGN="RIGHT"

    <FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="arial">One of the most frusterating things
    when you are first learning MFC is the &quot;Where am I?&quot;
    feeling you get. MFC has <I>hundreds</I> of classes, and the
    AppWizard adds several more. A good way to get around this feeling
    is to use a class hierarchy visualization tool like <A HREF="http://codevizor.iftech.com/rd/r_dcsb2cv.asp">CodeVizor</A>.
    With CodeVizor you can drag the source code for MFC into the
    CodeVizor tool and in about 30 seconds have a beautiful, clickable
    (and printable!) class hierarchy chart. You can even color classes
    individually or in groups so that they stand out! <BR>
    Get CodeVizor and see how much easier undestanding class hierarchies
    becomes!</FONT></TD>
  </TR></TBODY>
</TABLE><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You will next see a group of six colorful
option dialogs. You can move between them with the <B>Next</B>
and <B>Previous</B> buttons. Look through them now. We do not
want to change any of the default options, so when you are through
looking at them click the <B>Finish </B>button. You will see a
final dialog that summarizes your choices. Click <B>OK</B> on
this final dialog and the AppWizard will create the new framework,
after displaying what options have been selected so that you can
make sure it is what you really want.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Use the File Manager to look into the new
directory that the AppWizard created. It will contain about 20
files. Here's a quick summary of all of these different files:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SAMP.DSP, SAMP.DSW, SAMP.NCB, SAMP.OPT
  - The project and workspace files for the application.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SAMP.CLW - A data file used by the ClassWizard
  that you will never touch. If you accidentally delete it the
  ClassWizard will regenerate it for you.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">README.TXT - A text file that briefly
  describes most of the files in the directory.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">STDAFX.H, STDAFX.CPP - Short little files
  that help in the creation of <I>precompiled header</I> files.
  To speed compilation, Visual C++ can parse all of the header
  files (which are gigantic) and then save an image of the compiler's
  symbol table to disk. It is much quicker for the compiler to
  subsequently load the precompiled header file when compiling
  a CPP file. You will never touch these files.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SAMP.H, SAMP.CPP - If you look inside
  these files you will find that they contain a class derived from
  <B>CWinApp</B>, as must all MFC programs. There is also an overridden
  <B>InitInstance </B>function. You will sometimes have occasion
  to modify these files, and will use the message map in the application
  class to handle messages that apply application-wide.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">MAINFRM.H, MAINFRM.CPP - These files contain
  a class derived from <B>CMDIFrameWnd</B>. In an SDI application
  the class is derived from <B>CFrameWnd</B> (you control whether
  the AppWizard generates an SDI or MDI application in the first
  of the AppWizard's six configuration screens). You will typically
  leave these two files alone.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">CHILDFRM.H, CHILDFRM.CPP - These files
  contain a class derived from <B>CMDIChildWnd</B> and control
  the look of the child windows in the MDI shell. In an SDI application
  these files are omitted. You will typically leave these two files
  alone.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SAMPDOC.H, SAMPDOC.CPP - These two files
  derive a new class from <B>CDocument</B>. You will modify these
  files to create the document class for your application.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SAMPVIEW.H, SAMPVIEW.CPP - These two files
  derive a new class from <B>CView</B>. You will modify these files
  to create the view class for your application.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">RESOURCE.H, SAMP.RC, SAMP.APS - These
  three files compose the <I>resource file</I> for your application.
  You will find in a moment that the file contains an accelerator
  table, an About dialog, two icons, two menus, a fairly extensive
  string table, a toolbar, and version information.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Typically you will modify only the last
seven files when creating a new application. You will use the
ClassWizard to help with the modifications to the document and
view classes, and you will use the resource editors to modify
the resource files.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">A quick note on the workspace view in Visual
C++ 5.x. The workspace view typically appears on the left side
of the Visual C++ windows and looks like this (if you cannot see
it, choose the <B>Workspace</B> option in the <B>View</B> menu):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><IMG SRC="project.gif"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="310" HEIGHT="268" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The project window has 4 tabs along the
bottom. In the figure the <B>ClassView</B> tab is selected. This
view shows you all of the classes in the application. If you click
on the small plus signs, you can see the functions in each class.
You can double click on a class or function name and VC++ will
take you to that point in the code. The <B>ResourceView</B> tab
shows you the resources in the application. Open all of the resources
and look at them by double clicking. You will find that this application
has an accelerator table, an about dialog, two icons, two menus,
a string table, a toolbar and some version information. The <B>FileView</B>
tab shows you the files that make up the application (if you are
upgrading from VC++ 2.x this is the view you are familiar with).
You can delete files from the project here by selecting a file
and hitting the delete key. The <B>InfoView</B> tab shows you
the help files.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Build and execute this framework so that
you can see its default behavior. To do this, choose the <B>Build
samp.exe</B> option in the <B>Build</B> menu, and then choose
the <B>Execute samp.exe</B> option in the <B>Build</B> menu. You
will find that the application has the expected menu bar, and
that several of the menu options fully or partially work. For
example, the <B>Help</B> option brings up an about dialog and
the <B>Open</B> option brings up an open dialog. The application
has a toolbar, a status bar, an about box, etc. In other words,
it is a fairly complete application framework.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To get an idea of how you might modify this
framework using the ClassWizard, try the following example. Select
the <B>ClassWizard </B>option in the <B>View</B> menu. Make sure
that the <B>Message Maps</B> tab is selected. Make sure that the
<B>CSampView</B> class is selected in the <B>Class Name</B> combo
box. In the <B>Object Ids</B> list choose the first item: <B>CSampView</B>.
In the <B>Messages</B> list choose WM_MOUSEMOVE. Click the <B>Add
Function</B> button. Make sure that the <B>OnMouseMove</B> function
is selected in the <B>Member Functions</B> list and click the
<B>Edit Code</B> button. The ClassWizard will create the new <B>OnMouseMove</B>
function, add it appropriately to the message map, and then deposit
you at that point in the view class. Modify the function so that
it looks like this:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Build and execute the application. When
you drag the mouse in the window you will find that it draws small
5 by 5 rectangles whereever the mouse goes. The <B>CClientDC</B>
class creates a &quot;device context&quot; that allows you to
draw in a window. We use the dc to draw each rectangle. <B>CClientDC</B>
derives its behavior from the <B>CDC</B> class, which you will
find, when you look it up in the MFC help file (click on the word
and then press F1), contains about 100 different drawing functions.
Experiment if you like with these functions. They are all fairly
self explanatory. While you are in the help file it wouldn't hurt
to take a look at the <B>CDocument</B> and <B>CView</B> classes
to start getting a feel for them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To get an idea of how the resource editors
work, open SAMP.RC by clicking on the ResourceView tab in the
project window. Open the <B>Dialog</B> folder and then double
click on the IDD_ABOUTBOX dialog and the template for the About
box will appear. Click on one of the static text strings to bring
it into focus. Hit <B>Enter</B> and a dialog appears which you
can use to modify the string. Under the <B>General</B> tab, change
the text in the &quot;Caption:&quot; field. Build and execute
to see the changes to the About box.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In the next tutorial we will make a number
of changes to the document class, view class and resource file
to create a simple but complete drawing editor. <BR>
