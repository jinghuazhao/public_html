<!-- Force all text to format --><FONT FACE="arial">In this tutorial
we will examine a simple MFC program piece by piece to gain an
understanding of its structure and conceptual framework. We will
start by looking at MFC itself and then examine how MFC is used
to create applications.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">An Introduction to MFC</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">MFC is a large and extensive C++ class hierarchy
that makes Windows application development significantly easier.
MFC is compatible across the entire Windows family. As each new
version of Windows comes out, MFC gets modified so that old code
compiles and works under the new system. MFC also gets extended,
adding new capabilities to the hierarchy and making it easier
to create complete applications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The advantage of using MFC and C++ - as
opposed to directly accessing the Windows API from a C program-is
that MFC already contains and encapsulates all the normal &quot;boilerplate&quot;
code that all Windows programs written in C must contain. Programs
written in MFC are therefore much smaller than equivalent C programs.
On the other hand, MFC is a fairly thin covering over the C functions,
so there is little or no performance penalty imposed by its use.
It is also easy to customize things using the standard C calls
when necessary since MFC does not modify or hide the basic structure
of a Windows program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The best part about using MFC is that it
does all of the hard work for you. The hierarchy contains thousands
and thousands of lines of correct, optimized and robust Windows
code. Many of the member functions that you call invoke code that
would have taken you weeks to write yourself. In this way MFC
tremendously accelerates your project development cycle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">MFC is fairly large. For example, Version
4.0 of the hierarchy contains something like 200 different classes.
Fortunately, you don't need to use all of them in a typical program.
In fact, it is possible to create some fairly spectacular software
using only ten or so of the different classes available in MFC.
The hierarchy is broken into several different class categories
which include (but is not limited to):</FONT></P>

    <FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="arial">One of the most frusterating things
    when you are first learning MFC is the &quot;Where am I?&quot;
    feeling you get. MFC has <I>hundreds</I> of classes. A good way
    to get around this feeling is to use a class hierarchy visualization
    tool like <A HREF="http://codevizor.iftech.com/rd/r_dcsb2cv.asp">CodeVizor</A>.
    With CodeVizor you can drag the source code for MFC into the
    CodeVizor tool and in about 30 seconds have a beautiful, clickable
    (and printable!) class hierarchy chart. Get CodeVizor and see
    how much easier undestanding MFC becomes!</FONT></TD>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">We will concentrate on visual objects in
these tutorials. The list below shows the portion of the class
hierarchy that deals with application support and windows support.</FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">There are several things to notice in this
list. First, most classes in MFC derive from a base class called
<B>CObject</B>. This class contains data members and member functions
that are common to most MFC classes. The second thing to notice
is the simplicity of the list. The <B>CWinApp</B> class is used
whenever you create an application and it is used only once in
any program. The <B>CWnd</B> class collects all the common features
found in windows, dialog boxes, and controls. The <B>CFrameWnd</B>
class is derived from <B>CWnd</B> and implements a normal framed
application window. <B>CDialog</B> handles the two normal flavors
of dialogs: modeless and modal respectively. <B>CView</B> is used
to give a user access to a document through a window. Finally,
Windows supports six native control types: static text, editable
text, push buttons, scroll bars, lists, and combo boxes (an extended
form of list). Once you understand this fairly small number of
pieces, you are well on your way to a complete understanding of
MFC. The other classes in the MFC hierarchy implement other features
such as memory management, document control, data base support,
and so on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To create a program in MFC, you either use
its classes directly or, more commonly, you derive new classes
from the existing classes. In the derived classes you create new
member functions that allow instances of the class to behave properly
in your application. You can see this derivation process in the
simple program we used in Tutorial 1, which is described in greater
detail below. Both <B>CHelloApp</B> and <B>CHelloWindow</B> are
derived from existing MFC classes.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Designing a Program</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Before discussing the code itself, it is
worthwhile to briefly discuss the program design process under
MFC. As an example, imagine that you want to create a program
that displays the message &quot;Hello World&quot; to the user.
This is obviously a very simple application but it still requires
some thought.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">A &quot;hello world&quot; application first
needs to create a window on the screen that holds the words &quot;hello
world&quot;. It then needs to get the actual &quot;hello world&quot;
words into that window. Three objects are required to accomplish
this task:</FONT></P>

<OL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">An application object which initializes
  the application and hooks it to Windows. The application object
  handles all low-level event processing.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">A window object that acts as the main
  application window.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">A static text object which will hold the
  static text label &quot;hello world&quot;.</FONT>
</OL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Every program that you create in MFC will
contain the first two objects. The third object is unique to this
particular application. Each application will define its own set
of user interface objects that display the application's output
as well as gather input from the user.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Once you have completed the user interface
design and decided on the controls necessary to implement the
interface, you write the code to create the controls on the screen.
You also write the code that handles the messages generated by
these controls as they are manipulated by the user. In the case
of a &quot;hello world&quot; application, only one user interface
control is necessary. It holds the words &quot;hello world&quot;.
More realistic applications may have hundreds of controls arranged
in the main window and dialog boxes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">It is important to note that there are actually
two different ways to create user controls in a program. The method
described here uses straight C++ code to create the controls.
In a large application, however, this method becomes painful.
Creating the controls for an application containing 50 or 100
dialogs using C++ code to do it would take an eon. Therefore,
a second method uses <I>resource files</I> to create the controls
with a graphical dialog editor. This method is much faster and
works well on most dialogs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Understanding the Code for &quot;hello
world&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The listing below shows the code for the
simple &quot;hello world&quot; program that you entered, compiled
and executed in Tutorial 1. Line numbers have been added to allow
discussion of the code in the sections that follow. By walking
through this program line by line, you can gain a good understanding
of the way MFC is used to create simple applications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Take a moment and look through this program.
Get a feeling for the &quot;lay of the land.&quot; The program
consists of six small parts, each of which does something important.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The program first includes <TT>afxwin.h</TT>
(line 2). This header file contains all the types, classes, functions,
and variables used in MFC. It also includes other header files
for such things as the Windows API libraries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Lines 3 through 8 derive a new application
class named <B>CHelloApp </B>from the standard <B>CWinApp</B>
application class declared in MFC. The new class is created so
the <B>InitInstance</B> member function in the <B>CWinApp</B>
class can be overridden. <B>InitInstance </B>is a virtual function
that is called as the application begins execution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In Line 10, the code declares an instance
of the application object as a global variable. This instance
is important because it causes the program to execute. When the
application is loaded into memory and begins running, the creation
of that global variable causes the default constructor for the
<B>CWinApp</B> class to execute. This constructor automatically
calls the <B>InitInstance</B> function defined in lines 18 though
26.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In lines 11 through 17, the <B>CHelloWindow</B>
class is derived from the <B>CFrameWnd</B> class declared in MFC.
<B>CHelloWindow </B>acts as the application's window on the screen.
A new class is created so that a new constructor, destructor,
and data member can be implemented.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Lines 18 through 26 implement the <B>InitInstance</B>
function. This function creates an instance of the <B>CHelloWindow</B>
class, thereby causing the constructor for the class in Lines
27 through 41 to execute. It also gets the new window onto the
screen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Lines 27 through 41 implement the window's
constructor. The constructor actually creates the window and then
creates a static control inside it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">An interesting thing to notice in this program
is that there is no <B>main</B> or <B>WinMain</B> function, and
no apparent event loop. Yet we know from executing it in Tutorial
1 that it processed events. The window could be minimized and
maximized, moved around, and so on. All this activity is hidden
in the main application class <B>CWinApp</B> and we therefore
don't have to worry about it-event handling is totally automatic
and invisible in MFC.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The following sections describe the different
pieces of this program in more detail. It is unlikely that all
of this information will make complete sense to you right now:
It's best to read through it to get your first exposure to the
concepts. In Tutorial 3, where a number of specific examples are
discussed, the different pieces will come together and begin to
clarify themselves.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">The Application Object</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Every program that you create in MFC will
contain a single application object that you derive from the <B>CWinApp</B>
class. This object must be declared globally (line 10) and can
exist only once in any given program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">An object derived from the <B>CWinApp</B>
class handles initialization of the application, as well as the
main event loop for the program. The <B>CWinApp</B> class has
several data members, and a number of member functions. For now,
almost all are unimportant. If you would like to browse through
some of these functions however, search for <B>CWinApp </B>in
the MFC help file by choosing the <B>Search </B>option in the
<B>Help</B> menu and typing in &quot;CWinApp&quot;. In the program
above, we have overridden only one virtual function in <B>CWinApp</B>,
that being the <B>InitInstance</B> function.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The purpose of the application object is
to initialize and control your application. Because Windows allows
multiple instances of the same application to run simultaneously,
MFC breaks the initialization process into two parts and uses
two functions-<B>InitApplication </B>and <B>InitInstance</B>-to
handle it. Here we have used only the <B>InitInstance</B> function
because of the simplicity of the application. It is called each
time a new instance of the application is invoked. The code in
Lines 3 through 8 creates a class called <B>CHelloApp</B> derived
from <B>CWinApp</B>. It contains a new <B>InitInstance</B> function
that overrides the existing function in <B>CWinApp</B> (which
does nothing):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Inside the overridden <B>InitInstance</B>
function at lines 18 through 26, the program creates and displays
the window using <B>CHelloApp</B>'s data member named <B>m_pMainWnd</B>:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The <B>InitInstance</B> function returns
a TRUE value to indicate that initialization completed successfully.
Had the function returned a FALSE value, the application would
terminate immediately. We will see more details of the window
initialization process in the next section.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">When the application object is created at
line 10, its data members (inherited from <B>CWinApp</B>) are
automatically initialized. For example, <B>m_pszAppName</B>, <B>m_lpCmdLine</B>,
and <B>m_nCmdShow</B> all contain appropriate values. See the
MFC help file for more information. We'll see a use for one of
these variables in a moment.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">The Window Object</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">MFC defines two types of windows: 1) frame
windows, which are fully functional windows that can be re-sized,
minimized, and so on, and 2) dialog windows, which are not re-sizable.
A frame window is typically used for the main application window
of a program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In the code shown in listing 2.1, a new
class named <B>CHelloWindow </B>is derived from the <B>CFrameWnd</B>
class in lines 11 through 17:</FONT></P>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">11 // Declare the main window class</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">12 class CHelloWindow : public CFrameWnd</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">16 	CHelloWindow();</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">17 };</FONT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The derivation contains a new constructor,
along with a data member that will point to the single user interface
control used in the program. Each application that you create
will have a unique set of controls residing in the main application
window. Therefore, the derived class will have an overridden constructor
that creates all the controls required in the main window. Typically
this class will also have an overridden destructor to delete them
when the window closes, but the destructor is not used here. In
Tutorial 4, we will see that the derived window class will also
declare a message handler to handle messages that these controls
produce in response to user events.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Typically, any application you create will
have a single main application window. The <B>CHelloApp</B> application
class therefore defines a data member named <B>m_pMainWnd</B>
that can point to this main window. To create the main window
for this application, the <B>InitInstance</B> function (lines
18 through 26) creates an instance of <B>CHelloWindow</B> and
uses <B>m_pMainWnd</B> to point to the new window. Our <B>CHelloWindow</B>
object is created at line 22:</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">26 }</FONT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Simply creating a frame window is not enough,
however. Two other steps are required to make sure that the new
window appears on screen correctly. First, the code must call
the window's <B>ShowWindow </B>function to make the window appear
on screen (line 23). Second, the program must call the <B>UpdateWindow</B>
function to make sure that each control, and any drawing done
in the interior of the window, is painted correctly onto the screen
(line 24).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You may wonder where the <B>ShowWindow</B>
and <B>UpdateWindow </B>functions are defined. For example, if
you wanted to look them up to learn more about them, you might
look in the MFC help file (use the <B>Search</B> option in the
<B>Help </B>menu) at the <B>CFrameWnd</B> class description. <B>CFrameWnd
</B>does not contain either of these member functions, however.
It turns out that <B>CFrameWnd</B> inherits its behavior-as do
all controls and windows in MFC-from the <B>CWnd</B> class (see
figure 2.1). If you refer to <B>CWnd</B> in the MFC documentation,
you will find that it is a huge class containing over 200 different
functions. Obviously, you are not going to master this particular
class in a couple of minutes, but among the many useful functions
are <B>ShowWindow</B> and <B>UpdateWindow</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Since we are on the subject, take a minute
now to look up the <B>CWnd::ShowWindow</B> function in the MFC
help file. You do this by clicking the help file's <B>Search</B>
button and entering &quot;ShowWindow&quot;. As an alternative,
find the section describing the <B>CWnd</B> class using the <B>Search</B>
button, and then find the <B>ShowWindow</B> function under the
Update/Painting Functions in the class member list. Notice that
<B>ShowWindow </B>accepts a single parameter, and that the parameter
can be set to one of ten different values. We have set it to a
data member held by <B>CHelloApp</B> in our program, <B>m_nCmdShow</B>
(line 23). The <B>m_nCmdShow</B> variable is initialized based
on conditions set by the user at application start-up. For example,
the user may have started the application from the Program Manager
and told the Program Manager to start the application in the minimized
state by setting the check box in the application's properties
dialog. The <B>m_nCmdShow</B> variable will be set to SW_SHOWMINIMIZED,
and the application will start in an iconic state. The <B>m_nCmdShow
</B>variable is a way for the outside world to communicate with
the new application at start-up. If you would like to experiment,

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Line 22 initializes the window. It allocates
memory for it by calling the <B>new</B> function. At this point
in the program's execution the constructor for the <B>CHelloWindow</B>
is called. The constructor is called whenever an instance of the
class is allocated. Inside the window's constructor, the window
must create itself. It does this by calling the <B>Create</B>
member function for the <B>CFrameWnd</B> class at line 31:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Four parameters are passed to the create
function. By looking in the MFC documentation you can see the
different types. The initial NULL parameter indicates that a default
class name be used. The second parameter is the title of the window
that will appear in the title bar. The third parameter is the
style attribute for the window. This example indicates that a
normal, overlappable window should be created. Style attributes
are covered in detail in Tutorial 3. The fourth parameter specifies
that the window should be placed onto the screen with its upper
left corner at point 0,0, and that the initial size of the window
should be 200 by 200 pixels. If the value <B>rectDefault</B> is
used as the fourth parameter instead, Windows will place and size
the window automatically for you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Since this is an extremely simple program,
it creates a single static text control inside the window. In
this particular example, the program uses a single static text
label as its only control, and it is created at lines 35 through
40. More on this step in the next section.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">The Static Text Control</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The program derives the <B>CHelloWindow</B>
class from the <B>CFrameWnd </B>class (lines 11 through 17). In
doing so it declares a private data member of type <B>CStatic*</B>,
as well as a constructor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">As seen in the previous section, the <B>CHelloWindow</B>
constructor does two things. First it creates the application's
window by calling the <B>Create</B> function (line 31), and then
it allocates and creates the control that belongs inside the window.
In this case a single static label is used as the only control.
Object creation is always a two-step process in MFC. First, the
memory for the instance of the class is allocated, thereby calling
the constructor to initialize any variables. Next, an explicit
Create function is called to actually create the object on screen.
The code allocates, constructs, and creates a single static text
object using this two-step process at lines 36 through 40:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The constructor for the <B>CStatic</B> item
is called when the memory for it is allocated, and then an explicit
<B>Create</B> function is called to create the <B>CStatic</B>
control's window. The parameters used in the <B>Create</B> function
here are similar to those used for window creation at Line 31.
The first parameter specifies the text to be displayed by the
control. The second parameter specifies the style attributes.
The style attributes are discussed in detail in the next tutorial
but here we requested that the control be a child window (and
therefore displayed within another window), that it should be
visible, and that the text within the control should be centered.
The third parameter determines the size and position of the static
control. The fourth indicates the parent window for which this
control is the child. Having created the static control, it will
appear in the application's window and display the text specified.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In looking at this code for the first time,
it will be unfamiliar and therefore potentially annoying. Don't
worry about it. The only part in the entire program that matters
from an application programmer's perspective is the <B>CStatic</B>
creation code at lines 36 through 40. The rest you will type in
once and then ignore. In the next tutorial you will come to a
full understanding of what lines 36 through 40 do, and see a number
of options that you have in customizing a <B>CStatic</B> control.
