<!-- Force all text to format --><FONT FACE="arial">One of the
more interesting, and best hidden, features of any AppWizard framework
is something called <I>document templates </I>. In this tutorial
you will learn about document templates and see how you can add
new ones to your applications. By the end of the tutorial you
will have used document templates to create a single MDI application
that can display both text and drawing documents simultaneously.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Creating a Text Editor</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Let's start by using the AppWizard to create
a second type of application. In the previous tutorials we have
created a drawing editor. Here we will quickly create a text editor.
It is interesting to note that you can create a complete text
editor - one with all the features of Notepad, along with several
others as well - without writing a single line of code. Take the
following steps:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">In Visual C++, select the <B>New</B> option
  from the <B>File </B>menu, make sure the <B>Project</B> tab in
  the subsequent dialog is selected, and name the new project &quot;Ed&quot;.
  Make sure the type is set to <B>MFC AppWizard (EXE)</B> and select
  an appropriate directory. Click <B>OK</B> and look over the AppWizard's
  options in the six configuration screens.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">We want to change two things in the configuration
  screens: First we want to give a default file extension, and
  second we want to change the view class. In the fourth screen
  of the six, click the <B>Advanced</B> button and type &quot;tex&quot;
  into the <B>File Extension</B> field. In the sixth screen, click
  on <B>CEdView</B>, and at the bottom of the dialog change the
  <B>Base Class</B> to <B>CEditView</B> using the combo box.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Compile and run the program. You will
  find that you have a complete MDI text editor. You can load and
  save text files, cut, copy and paste text, print files, and so
  on.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">If you look at the help page for the <B>CEditView</B>
  class, you will find that it automatically understands certain
  menu options. In particular, if you add menu options with the
  IDs of ID_EDIT_FIND, ID_EDIT_REPEAT, ID_EDIT_REPLACE and ID_EDIT_SELECT_ALL,
  the program will <I>automatically</I> recognize these new options
  and perform them properly. You do not need to add anything but
  the menu options. Do that now and test the program.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">This application was so easy to create because
the <B>CEditView </B>class has all of the behavior of a normal
text editor built into it. There is just one line of code that
the AppWizard had to add to make the whole thing work, and that
line can be found in the <B>Serialize</B> function of the document
class. It looks like this:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">((CEditView*)m_viewList.GetHead())-&gt;SerializeRaw(ar);</FONT></TT>
</PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">That line loads and saves text files. Just
so you are aware of it, the <B>CEditView</B> class violates the
strict separation of document and view. The <B>CEditView</B> class
contains a normal <B>CEdit</B> control, and this control holds
the editor's data itself. Therefore, the data resides inside the
<B>CEditView</B> class rather than in the document class, and
the line of code above gets or sets that data. Because of this
odd structure, you will want to remove the <B>New Window</B> option
from the <B>Window </B>menu. Since the document does not hold
the data, it is not possible to have multiple views display the
same document. This seems like a small price to pay for the ease
of using the <B>CEditView </B>class to create quickie text editors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now that you have created a complete text
editor, let's see what steps are necessary to create a single
MDI application that can display both text and drawing documents.
To do this, we will take the drawing program from the previous
tutorials and modify it so that it can also display text documents.
To do this, three steps are required:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Step 1: Start with the drawing program
  and add a new document and view class for the text editor</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Step 2: Create a new document template
  for the new document type</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Step 3: Add three new resources to the
  drawing editor</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Once you have completed these three steps,
the program will be able to display both text and drawing documents
simultaneously.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 1: Add a new document and view class</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Open the workspace file for the drawing
editor (samp) in Visual C++. Choose the <B>ClassWizard</B> option
in the <B>View</B> menu. Click the <B>Add Class</B> button and
select <B>New</B>. You will see a dialog with several fields.
In the <B>Name</B> field type <B>CEdDoc </B>. In the <B>Base Class</B>
field choose <B>CDocument</B>. The ClassWizard will choose a file
name of EDDOC.CPP, and this name is fine. Click the <B>OK</B>
button. Click the <B>Add Class</B> button again to create another
new class. Type <B>CEdView</B> into the <B>Name</B> field and
choose <B>CEditView</B> for the base class type. The file name
EDVIEW.CPP chosen by the ClassWizard is fine. Click the <B>OK</B>
button. Close the ClassWizard by clicking its <B>OK</B> button.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now modify the <B>Serialize</B> function
in the new document class (CEdDoc) so it contains the line seen
in the text editor:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">((CEditView*)m_viewList.GetHead())-&gt;SerializeRaw(ar);</FONT></TT>
</PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The two new CPP files were automatically
added to the drawing project by the ClassWizard. You will add
the header files to the CSampApp class in the next step.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 2: Add a new document template</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Open the CSampApp class, which contains
the application class for the application derived from <B>CWinApp</B>,
in the ClassView so that you can see a list of its functions.
Find the <B>InitInstance </B>function. Double click on it. Look
for the following lines:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"> CMultiDocTemplate* pDocTemplate;</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"> pDocTemplate = new CMultiDocTemplate(</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    IDR_SAMPTYPE,</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    RUNTIME_CLASS(CSampDoc),</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    RUNTIME_CLASS(CChildFrame), // custom MDI child frame</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    RUNTIME_CLASS(CSampView));</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"> AddDocTemplate(pDocTemplate);</FONT></TT>
</PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">These lines create a <I>document template</I>.
The <B>CWinApp </B>class (see the help file) has built into it
the ability to hold a list of document templates. When it holds
more than one, it changes the behavior of the application slightly.
For example, the <B>New</B> option pops up a list that lets the
user choose what type of document he/she wishes to create. What
we want to do is change the program so that it contains two templates:
one for drawing documents, and another for text documents. Modify
the above code so that it looks like this:</FONT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">CMultiDocTemplate* pDocTemplate;</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">pDocTemplate = new CMultiDocTemplate(</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    IDR_EDTYPE,</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    RUNTIME_CLASS(CEdDoc),</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    RUNTIME_CLASS(CChildFrame),          // custom MDI child frame</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    RUNTIME_CLASS(CEdView));</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">AddDocTemplate(pDocTemplate); </FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">pDocTemplate = new CMultiDocTemplate(</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    IDR_SAMPTYPE,</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    RUNTIME_CLASS(CSampDoc),</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    RUNTIME_CLASS(CChildFrame),          // custom MDI child frame</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">    RUNTIME_CLASS(CSampView));</FONT></TT>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">AddDocTemplate(pDocTemplate);</FONT></TT>
</PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Note that a new document template has been
created. The new one goes first (more on the reason for that in
a moment). It specifies IDR_EDTYPE, <B>CEdDoc</B> and <B>CEdView</B>.
But what does that mean?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The purpose of a document template is to
relate a resource type (IDR_EDTYPE), a document class, a view
class, and a window class. When the application framework needs
to create a new instance of a document for the user, it looks
to the document template, which tells it to create a new instance
of the appropriate document, view and window classes. The resource
ID is used when the framework needs to change resources. It identifies
a specific menu, icon and string resource. So, for example, when
the user clicks on a window in the MDI shell, the application
framework brings that window to the foreground <I>and</I> it changes
the menu to the one appropriate for that window, according to
the window's document template.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">We put the text document template first
because, if the user attempts to open a document whose extension
is unknown to the application, the application tries to open it
under the first document template registered. Since text documents
are far more likely than drawing documents, the text template
is placed first in the list of document templates.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial">Be sure to include EDDOC.H and EDVIEW.H
at the top of SAMP.CPP.</FONT></I></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 3: Create resources</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The new document template specifies a resource
ID of IDR_EDTYPE. If you open the ResourceView and look through
its resources, you will find that it already contains three resources
of type IDR_SAMPTYPE as needed by the drawing editor: a menu,
an icon, and a string near the top of the string table. The easiest
way to create new resources for the text editor type is to copy
these three IDR_SAMPTYPE resources to the clipboard, paste them
back, and then change their names to IDR_EDTYPE using the <B>Properties</B>
option in the <B>View</B> menu. Then modify them as appropriate.
For example, to the IDR_EDTYPE menu you will want to add the ID_EDIT_FIND,
ID_EDIT_REPEAT, ID_EDIT_REPLACE and ID_EDIT_SELECT_ALL options
(also delete the <B>Option</B> menu that got copied). You will
also want to remove the <B>New Window</B> option from the Window
menu. Change the IDR_EDTYPE icon as you see fit. Change the IDR_EDTYPE
string so that it looks like this:</FONT></P>

<PRE>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">\nEd\nEd\nEd Files (*.tex)\n.TEX\nEd.Document\nEd Document</FONT></TT>
</PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">For more information about this mysterious
string, search for the <B>GetDocString </B>function in the help
file. It will explain what all seven of the substrings do. Now
that you understand the strings, modify the IDR_SAMPTYPE string
as well so it contains a file extension:</FONT></P>

<PRE>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">\nDrawing\nDrawing\nDrawing Files (*.drw)\n.DRW\nDrawing.Document\nDraw Document</FONT></TT>
</PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Change the two strings in any way that you
like.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Step 4 : Build and execute</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Build the new application and run it. When
it starts you should see a new dialog that lets you choose whether
you want to create a text or drawing document. Choose text, and
verify that the text editor works properly. Now choose <B>New</B>
and create a drawing document. Draw something. Note that when
you change windows the menu bar changes as appropriate.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You can see that adding a new document template
is easy, and there is really no limit to the number of templates
a single application might have. As you create more complex applications,
you will find this to be an extremely useful feature of the AppWizard
framework.</FONT>
