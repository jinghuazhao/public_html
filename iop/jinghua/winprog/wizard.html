<!-- Force all text to format --><FONT FACE="arial">It is possible
to use the Visual C++ development environment as a big C compiler.
Using it that way you can certainly create GUI applications using
the Win32 API. However, you will be wasting a lot of the potential
of the environment. Visual C++ contains a variety of visual tools
that, once you know how to use them, can tremendously accelerate
your software development cycle. These tools, which include the
AppWizard, ClassWizard and the resource editors, make full use
of the C++ language and the MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes)
class hierarchy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The problem with these tools is that they
are fairly complicated, and there is not much introductory material
available on how to use them. The purpose of these tutorials is
to show you, using extremely clear and easy-to-understand examples,
exactly what the AppWizard and ClassWizard are, what they can
do, and exactly how to use them. Along the way you will find out
why the AppWizard generates 20 files and what all of those files
do, what the &quot;document/view paradigm&quot; is and how it
makes application development easier, and how to fit the code
you develop into an AppWizard framework with a minimum amount
of effort on your part. Once you have finished these tutorials
you will have a very clear understanding of why these tools exist
and how you can use them to create your own applications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Note: If you do not know C++ these tutorials
will be opaque to you. Please run through the C++ tutorials first.
If you do not have any knowledge of MFC these tutorials will be
fairly muddy. Please look at the introductory MFC tutorials first.</FONT></P>
