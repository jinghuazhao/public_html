<!-- Force all text to format --><FONT FACE="arial">The Visual
C++ development environment comes with three different tools that
can tremendously accelerate your software development cycle: The
AppWizard, the ClassWizard and the resource editors. The latter
is a collection of editors that you use individually to edit specific
resource types. This tutorial will introduce you to these tools
in a general way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The <I>AppWizard</I> is a &quot;template
generator.&quot; Think about what you normally do when you begin
any new project. Typically you would find some piece of code that
you know works, and then you would strip out all of the things
that you do not need from the old application. Then you would
add in all of the functionality for the new application. The AppWizard
saves you the first step. It generates a clean code template for
you to use as the starting point for any new application that
you want to create. The AppWizard gives you a number of different
options as you are creating the template, and you choose among
these options depending on what type of application you are planning
to create. You will use the AppWizard exactly once for each application
you create. After it has generated the template, the AppWizard
is finished.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The template, or framework, that the AppWizard
generates is an extremely complete MFC application consisting
of twenty or so different files. See tutorial 3 for a description
of these different files.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The <I>ClassWizard</I> is a tool that you
can use to perform specific modifications to an AppWizard framework.
In particular, you will most often use the ClassWizard to modify
message maps, to generate new classes derived from existing MFC
classes, and to add member variables to certain classes. The ClassWizard
can also perform several other tasks related to OLE automation
code and OCX code. The ClassWizard is only useful if you are working
within a framework generated by the AppWizard.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial">Resources</FONT></I><FONT FACE="arial">
are user interface objects that you can create with visual <I>resource
editors</I>. Resources include bitmaps, cursors, dialogs, icons,
menus and their accelerator table, string tables and version information.
Although you could do what resources do with normal MFC code (for
example, you could hand-code a menu or a dialog using normal MFC
code written in C++), resources are generally much easier to create
and apply in a program. Therefore, the use of resources speeds
your application development cycle. Resources have the added advantage
of concentrating language-specific parts of your user interface
in a specific place that is completely separate from your C++
code. So, for example, you can create an English, French and Spanish
version of your resources and, without changing any of your C++
code, easily create three different versions of your application
in three different languages.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">When you are creating applications using
these tools, you will typically start by creating the application's
initial framework with the AppWizard. The framework will include
all of the normal menu options like File Open, Edit Cut/Copy/Paste,
and the Help menu. You will then use the Resource Editors to add
new menu items, dialogs, etc. to your application. You will use
the Class Wizard to modify message maps, override virtual functions,
add new classes, and so on to the application. Because these tools
do so much of the grunt work for you, they significantly increase
your development speed and reduce the number of errors you make.
