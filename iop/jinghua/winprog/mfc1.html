<!-- Force all text to format --><FONT FACE="arial">Visual C++
is much more than a compiler. It is a complete application development
environment that, when used as intended, lets you fully exploit
the object oriented nature of C++ to create professional Windows
applications. In order to take advantage of these features, you
need to understand the C++ programming language. If you have never
used C++, please turn to the C++ tutorials in the <A HREF="http://devcentral.iftech.com/learning/tutorials/subcpp.asp">C/C++
Tutorials page</A> for an introduction. You must then understand
the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) hierarchy. This class hierarchy
encapsulates the user interface portion of the Windows API, and
makes it significantly easier to create Windows applications in
an object oriented way. This hierarchy is available for and compatible
with all versions of Windows. The code you create in MFC is extremely
portable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">These tutorials introduce the fundamental
concepts and vocabulary behind MFC and event driven programming.
In this tutorial you will enter, compile, and run a simple MFC
program using Visual C++. Tutotial 2 provides a detailed explanation
of the code used in Tutorial 1. Tutorial 3 discusses MFC controls
and their customization. Tutorial 4 covers message maps, which
let you handle events in MFC.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">What is the Microsoft Foundations Class
Library?</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Let's say you want to create a Windows application.
You might, for example, need to create a specialized text or drawing
editor, or a program that finds files on a large hard disk, or
an application that lets a user visualize the interrelationships
in a big data set. Where do you begin?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">A good starting place is the design of the
user interface. First, decide what the user should be able to
do with the program and then pick a set of user interface objects
accordingly. The Windows user interface has a number of standard
controls, such as buttons, menus, scroll bars, and lists, that
are already familiar to Windows users. With this in mind, the
programmer must choose a set of controls and decide how they should
be arranged on screen. A time-honored procedure is to make a rough
sketch of the proposed user interface (by tradition on a napkin
or the back of an envelope) and play with the elements until they
feel right. For small projects, or for the early prototyping phase
of a larger project, this is sufficient.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The next step is to implement the code.
When creating a program for any Windows platform, the programmer
has two choices: C or C++. With C, the programmer codes at the
level of the Windows Application Program Interface (API). This
interface consists of a collection of hundreds of C functions
described in the Window's API Reference books. For Window's NT,
the API is typically referred to as the &quot;Win32 API,&quot;
to distinguish it from the original 16-bit API of lower-level
Windows products like Windows 3.1.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Microsoft also provides a C++ library that
sits on top of any of the Windows APIs and makes the programmer's
job easier. Called the Microsoft Foundation Class library (MFC),
this library's primary advantage is efficiency. It greatly reduces
the amount of code that must be written to create a Windows program.
It also provides all the advantages normally found in C++ programming,
such as inheritance and encapsulation. MFC is portable, so that,
for example, code created under Windows 3.1 can move to Windows
NT or Windows 95 very easily. MFC is therefore the preferred method
for developing Windows applications and will be used throughout
these tutorials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">When you use MFC, you write code that creates
the necessary user interface controls and customizes their appearance.
You also write code that responds when the user manipulates these
controls. For example, if the user clicks a button, you want to
have code in place that responds appropriately. It is this sort
of event-handling code that will form the bulk of any application.
Once the application responds correctly to all of the available
controls, it is finished.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You can see from this discussion that the
creation of a Windows program is a straightforward process when
using MFC. The goal of these tutorials is to fill in the details
and to show the techniques you can use to create professional
applications as quickly as possible. The Visual C++ application
development environment is specifically tuned to MFC, so by learning
MFC and Visual C++ together you can significantly increase your
power as an application developer.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Windows Vocabulary</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The vocabulary used to talk about user interface
features and software development in Windows is basic but unique.
Here we review a few definitions to make discussion easier for
those who are new to the environment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Windows applications use several standard
user controls:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Static text labels</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Push buttons</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">List boxes</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Combo boxes (a more advanced form of list)</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Radio boxes</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Check boxes</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Editable text areas (single and multi-line)</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Scroll bars</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You can create these controls either in
code or through a &quot;resource editor&quot; that can create
dialogs and the controls inside of them. In this set of tutorials
we will examine how to create them in code. See the tutorials
on the AppWizard and ClassWizard on the <A HREF="http://devcentral.iftech.com/learning/tutorials/submfc.asp">MFC
Tutorials page</A> for an introduction to the resource editor
for dialogs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Windows supports several types of application
windows. A typical application will live inside a &quot;frame
window&quot;. A frame window is a fully featured main window that
the user can re-size, minimize, maximize to fill the screen, and
so on. Windows also supports two types of dialog boxes: modal
and modeless. A modal dialog box, once on the screen, blocks input
to the rest of the application until it is answered. A modeless
dialog box can appear at the same time as the application and
seems to &quot;float above&quot; it to keep from being overlaid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Most simple Windows applications use a Single
Document Interface, or SDI, frame. The Clock, PIF editor, and
Notepad are examples of SDI applications. Windows also provides
an organizing scheme called the Multiple Document Interface, or
MDI for more complicated applications. The MDI system allows the
user to view multiple documents at the same time within a single
instance of an application. For example, a text editor might allow
the user to open multiple files simultaneously. When implemented
with MDI, the application presents a large application window
that can hold multiple sub-windows, each containing a document.
The single main menu is held by the main application window and
it applies to the top-most window held within the MDI frame. Individual
windows can be iconified or expanded as desired within the MDI
frame, or the entire MDI frame can be minimized into a single
icon on the desktop. The MDI interface gives the impression of
a second desktop out on the desktop, and it goes a long way towards
organizing and removing window clutter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Each application that you create will use
its own unique set of controls, its own menu structure, and its
own dialog boxes. A great deal of the effort that goes into creating
any good application interface lies in the choice and organization
of these interface objects. Visual C++, along with its resource
editors, makes the creation and customization of these interface
objects extremely easy.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Event-driven Software and Vocabulary</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">All window-based GUIs contain the same basic
elements and all operate in the same way. On screen the user sees
a group of windows, each of which contains controls, icons, objects
and such that are manipulated with the mouse or the keyboard.
The interface objects seen by the user are the same from system
to system: push buttons, scroll bars, icons, dialog boxes, pull
down menus, etc. These interface objects all work the same way,
although some have minor differences in their &quot;look and feel.&quot;
For example, scroll bars look slightly different as you move from
Windows to the Mac to Motif, but they all do the same thing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">From a programmer's standpoint, the systems
are all similar in concept, although they differ radically in
their specifics. To create a GUI program, the programmer first
puts all of the needed user interface controls into a window.
For example, if the programmer is trying to create a simple program
such as a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter, then the programmer
selects user interface objects appropriate to the task and displays
them on screen. In this example, the programmer might let the
user enter a temperature in an editable text area, display the
converted temperature in another un-editable text area, and let
the user exit the program by clicking on a push-button labeled
&quot;quit&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">As the user manipulates the application's
controls, the program must respond appropriately. The responses
are determined by the user's actions on the different controls
using the mouse and the keyboard. Each user interface object on
the screen will respond to events differently. For example, if
the user clicks the Quit button, the button must update the screen
appropriately, highlighting itself as necessary. Then the program
must respond by quitting. Normally the button manages its appearance
itself, and the program in some way receives a message from the
button that says, &quot;The quit button was pressed. Do something
about it.&quot; The program responds by exiting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Windows follows this same general pattern.
In a typical application you will create a main window and place
inside it different user interface controls. These controls are
often referred to as child windows-each control is like a smaller
and more specialized sub-window inside the main application window.
As the application programmer, you manipulate the controls by
sending messages via function calls, and they respond to user
actions by sending messages back to your code.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">If you have never done any &quot;event-driven&quot;
programming, then all of this may seem foreign to you. However,
the event-driven style of programming is easy to understand. The
exact details depend on the system and the level at which you
are interfacing with it, but the basic concepts are similar. In
an event-driven interface, the application paints several (or
many) user interface objects such as buttons, text areas, and
menus onto the screen. Now the application waits-typically in
a piece of code called an event loop-for the user to do something.
The user can do anything to any of the objects on screen using
either the mouse or the keyboard. The user might click one of
the buttons, for example. The mouse click is called an event.
Event driven systems define events for user actions such as mouse
clicks and keystrokes, as well as for system activities such as
screen updating.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">At the lowest level of abstraction, you
have to respond to each event in a fair amount of detail. This
is the case when you are writing normal C code directly to the
API. In such a scenario, you receive the mouse-click event in
some sort of structure. Code in your event loop looks at different
fields in the structure, determines which user interface object
was affected, perhaps highlights the object in some way to give
the user visual feedback, and then performs the appropriate action
for that object and event. When there are many objects on the
screen the application becomes very large. It can take quite a
bit of code simply to figure out which object was clicked and
what to do about it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Fortunately, you can work at a much higher
level of abstraction. In MFC, almost all these low-level implementation
details are handled for you. If you want to place a user interface
object on the screen, you create it with two lines of code. If
the user clicks on a button, the button does everything needed
to update its appearance on the screen and then calls a pre-arranged
function in your program. This function contains the code that
implements the appropriate action for the button. MFC handles
all the details for you: You create the button and tell it about
a specific handler function, and it calls your function when the
user presses it. Tutorial 4 shows you how to handle events using
message maps</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">An Example</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">One of the best ways to begin understanding
the structure and style of a typical MFC program is to enter,
compile, and run a small example. The listing below contains a
simple &quot;hello world&quot; program. If this is the first time
you've seen this sort of program, it probably will not make a
lot of sense initially. Don't worry about that. We will examine
the code in detail in the next tutorial. For now, the goal is
to use the Visual C++ environment to create, compile and execute
this simple program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">This small program does three things. First,
it creates an &quot;application object.&quot; Every MFC program
you write will have a single application object that handles the
initialization details of MFC and Windows. Next, the application
creates a single window on the screen to act as the main application
window. Finally, inside that window the application creates a
single static text label containing the words &quot;hello world&quot;.
We will look at this program in detail in the next tutorial to
gain a complete understanding of its structure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The steps necessary to enter and compile
this program are straightforward. If you have not yet installed
Visual C++ on your machine, do so now. You will have the option
of creating standard and custom installations. For the purposes
of these tutorials a standard installation is suitable and after
answering two or three simple questions the rest of the installation
is quick and painless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The compilation instructions supplied here
apply specifically to Visual C++ version 6.x under Windows NT
or Windows 95. If you are using Visual C++ version 1.5, 2.x, 4.x
or 5.x then you will want to see the tutorials for these versions
on the <A HREF="http://devcentral.iftech.com/learning/tutorials/submfc.asp">MFC
Tutorials page</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Start VC++ by double clicking on its icon
in the Visual C++ group of the Program Manager. If you have just
installed the product, you will see an empty window with a menu
bar. If VC++ has been used before on this machine, it is possible
for it to come up in several different states because VC++ remembers
and automatically reopens the project and files in use the last
time it exited. What we want right now is a state where it has
no project or code loaded. If the program starts with a dialog
that says it was unable to find a certain file, clear the dialog
by clicking the &quot;No&quot; button. Go to the <B>Window</B>
menu and select the <B>Close All </B>option if it is available.
Go to the <B>File</B> menu and select the <B>Close </B>option
if it is available to close any remaining windows. Now you are
at the proper starting point. If you have just installed the package,
you will see a window that looks something like this:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><IMG SRC="intro2.gif" HEIGHT="367"
ALT="" WIDTH="500" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">This screen can be rather intimidating the
first time you see it. To eliminate some of the intimidation,
click on the lower of the two &quot;x&quot; buttons (<IMG SRC="killit.gif"
HEIGHT="16" ALT="" WIDTH="18" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" 
ALIGN="BOTTOM">) that you see in the upper right hand corner of
the screen if it is available. This action will let you close
the &quot;InfoViewer Topic&quot; window. If you want to get rid
of the InfoViewer toolbar as well, you can drag it so it docks
somewhere along the side of the window, or close it and later
get it back by choosing the <B>Customize</B> option in the <B>Tools</B>
menu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">What you see now is &quot;normal&quot;.
Along the top is the menu bar and several toolbars. Along the
left side are all of the topics available from the on-line book
collection (you might want to explore by double clicking on several
of the items you see there - the collection of information found
in the on-line books is gigantic). Along the bottom is a status
window where various messages will be displayed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now what? What you would like to do is type
in the above program, compile it and run it. Before you start,
switch to the File Manager (or the MS-DOS prompt) and make sure
your drive has at least five megabytes of free space available.
Then take the following steps.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Creating a Project and Compiling the Code</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In order to compile any code in Visual C++,
you have to create a <I>project</I>. With a very small program
like this the project seems like overkill, but in any real program
the project concept is quite useful. A project holds three different
types of information:</FONT></P>

<OL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">It remembers all of the source code files
  that combine together to create one executable. In this simple
  example, the file HELLO.CPP will be the only source file, but
  in larger applications you often break the code up into several
  different files to make it easier to understand (and also to
  make it possible for several people to work on it simultaneously).
  The project maintains a list of the different source files and
  compiles all of them as necessary each time you want to create
  a new executable.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">It remembers compiler and linker options
  particular to this specific application. For example, it remembers
  which libraries to link into the executable, whether or not you
  want to use pre-compiled headers, and so on.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">It remembers what type of project you
  wish to build: a console application, a windows application,
  etc.</FONT>
</OL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">If you are familiar with makefiles, then
it is easy to think of a project as a machine-generated makefile
that has a very easy-to-understand user interface to manipulate
it. For now we will create a very simple project file and use
it to compile HELLO.CPP.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To create a new project for HELLO.CPP, choose
the <B>New</B> option in the <B>File </B>menu. Under the <B>Projects
</B>tab, highlight <B>Win32 Application</B>. In the Location field
type an appropriate path name or click the Browse button. Type
the word &quot;hello&quot; in for the project name, and you will
see that word echoed in the Location field as well. Click the
OK button. In the next window, use the default selection &quot;An
empty project&quot;, click &quot;Finish&quot;, then click &quot;OK&quot;
once more in the next window. Notice there is an option for the
typical &quot;Hello World&quot; application, however it skips
a few important steps you are about to take. Visual C++ will create
a new subdirectory named HELLO and place the project files named
HELLO.OPT, HELLO.NCB, HELLO.DSP, and HELLO.DSW in that directory.
If you quit and later want to reopen the project, double-click
on HELLO.DSW.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The area along the left side of the screen
will now change so that three tabs are available. The InfoView
tab is still there, but there is now also a ClassView and a FileView
tab. The ClassView tab will show you a list of all of the classes
in your application and the FileView tab gives you a list of all
of the files in the project.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now it is time to type in the code for the
program. In the <B>File</B> menu select the <B>New</B> option
to create a new editor window. In the dialog that appears, make
sure the <B>Files</B> tab is active and request a &quot;C++ Source
File&quot;. Make sure the &quot;Add to Project&quot; option is
checked for Project &quot;hello&quot;, and enter &quot;hello&quot;
for &quot;File name&quot;. Visual C++ comes with its own intelligent
C++ editor, and you will use it to enter the program shown above.
Type (copy/paste) the code in the listing into the editor window.
You will find that the editor automatically colors different pieces
of text such as comments, key words, string literals, and so on.
If you want to change the colors or turn the coloring off, go
to the <B>Options </B>option in the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose
the <B>Format</B> tab and select the <B>Source Windows</B> option
from the left hand list. If there is some aspect of the editor
that displeases you, you may be able to change it using the <B>Editor
</B>tab of the <B>Options</B> dialog.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">After you have finished entering the code,
save the file by selecting the <B>Save</B> option in the <B>File</B>
menu. Save it to a file named HELLO.CPP in the new directory Visual
C++ created.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In the area on the left side of the screen,
click the FileView tab and expand the tree on the icon labeled
&quot;hello files&quot;, then expand the tree on the folder icon
labeled &quot;Source Files&quot;. You will see the file named
HELLO.CPP. Click on the ClassView tab and expand the &quot;hello
classes&quot; tree and you will see the classes in the application.
You can remove a file from a project at any time by going to the
FileView, clicking the file, and pressing the delete button.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="arial">Finally, <B>you must now tell the project
to use the MFC library</B>. If you omit this step the project
will not link properly, and the error messages that the linker
produces will not help one bit.</FONT></I><FONT FACE="arial">
Choose the <B>Settings</B> option in the <B>Project</B> menu.
Make sure that the <B>General</B> tab is selected in the tab at
the top of the dialog that appears. In the <B>Microsoft Foundation
Classes</B> combo box, choose the third option: &quot;Use MFC
in a Shared DLL.&quot; Then close the dialog.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Having created the project file and adjusted
the settings, you are ready to compile the HELLO.CPP program.
In the <B>Build </B>menu you will find three different compile
options:</FONT></P>

<OL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Compile HELLO.CPP (only available if the
  text window for HELLO.CPP has focus)</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Build HELLO.EXE</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Rebuild All</FONT>
</OL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The first option simply compiles the source
file listed and forms the object file for it. This option does
not perform a link, so it is useful only for quickly compiling
a file to check for errors. The second option compiles all of
the source files in the project that have been modified since
the last build, and then links them to form an executable. The
third option recompiles all of the source files in the project
and relinks them. It is a &quot;compile and link from scratch&quot;
option that is useful after you change certain compiler options
or move to a different platform.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In this case, choose the <B>Build HELLO.EXE</B>
option in the <B>Build</B> menu to compile and link the code.
Visual C++ will create a new subdirectory named Debug and place
the executable named HELLO.EXE in that new subdirectory. This
subdirectory holds all disposable (easily recreated) files generated
by the compiler, so you can delete this directory when you run
short on disk space without fear of losing anything important.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">If you see compiler errors, simply double
click on the error message in the output window. The editor will
take you to that error. Compare your code against the code above
and fix the problem. If you see a mass of linker errors, it probably
means that you specified the project type incorrectly in the dialog
used to create the project. You may want to simply delete your
new directory and recreate it again following the instructions
given above exactly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To execute the program, choose the <B>Execute
HELLO.EXE </B>option in the <B>Build </B>menu. A window appears
with the words &quot;hello world&quot;. The window itself has
the usual decorations: a title bar, re-size areas, minimize and
maximize buttons, and so on. Inside the window is a static label
displaying the words &quot;hello world&quot;. Note that the program
is complete. You can move the window, re-size it, minimize it,
and cover and uncover it with other windows. With a very small
amount of code you have created a complete Window application.
This is one of the many advantages of using MFC. All the details
are handled elsewhere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To terminate the program, click on its system
menu (the small box to the left of the title bar) and select the
Close option.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In this tutorial you have successfully compiled
and executed your first program. You will use these same steps
for each of the programs you create in the following tutorials.
You will find that you can either create a separate directory
for each project that you create, or you can create a single project
file and then add and remove different source files.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In the next tutorial, we will examine this
program in detail so you may gain a more complete understanding
of its structure. <BR>
