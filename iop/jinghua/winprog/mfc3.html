<!-- Force all text to format --><I><FONT FACE="arial">Controls</FONT></I><FONT
 FACE="arial"> are the user interface objects used to create interfaces
for Windows applications. Most Windows applications and dialog
boxes that you see are nothing but a collection of controls arranged
in a way that appropriately implements the functionality of the
program. In order to build effective applications, you must completely
understand how to use the controls available in Windows. There
are only six basic controls-<B>CStatic</B>, <B>CButton </B>, <B>CEdit</B>,
<B>CList</B>, <B>CComboBox</B>, and <B>CScrollBar </B>-along with
some minor variations (also note that Windows 95 added a collection
of about 15 enhanced controls as well). You need to understand
what each control can do, how you can tune its appearance and
behavior, and how to make the controls respond appropriately to
user events. By combining this knowledge with an understanding
of menus and dialogs you gain the ability to create any Windows
application that you can imagine. You can create controls either
programatically as shown in this tutorial, or through resource
files using the dialog resource editor. While the dialog editor
is much more convenient, it is extremely useful to have a general
understanding of controls that you gain by working with them programatically
as shown here and in the next tutorial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The simplest of the controls, <B>CStatic</B>,
displays static text. The <B>CStatic</B> class has no data members
and only a few member functions: the constructor, the <B>Create</B>
function for getting and setting icons on static controls, and
several others. It does not respond to user events. Because of
its simplicity, it is a good place to start learning about Windows
controls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In this tutorial we will look at the <B>CStatic</B>
class to understand how controls can be modified and customized.
In the following tutorial, we examine the <B>CButton</B> and <B>CScrollBar</B>
classes to gain an understanding of event handling. Once you understand
all of the controls and classes, you are ready to build complete
applications.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">The Basics</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">A <B>CStatic</B> class in MFC displays static
text messages to the user. These messages can serve purely informational
purposes (for example, text in a message dialog that describes
an error), or they can serve as small labels that identify other
controls. Pull open a File Open dialog in any Windows application
and you will find six text labels. Five of the labels identify
the lists, text area, and check box and do not ever change. The
sixth displays the current directory and changes each time the
current directory changes.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="arial">CStatic</FONT></B><FONT FACE="arial">
objects have several other display formats. By changing the <I>style</I>
of a label it can display itself as a solid rectangle, as a border,
or as an icon. The rectangular solid and frame forms of the <B>CStatic</B>
class allow you to visually group related interface elements and
to add separators between controls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">A <B>CStatic</B> control is always a child
window to some parent window. Typically, the parent window is
a main window for an application or a dialog box. You create the
static control, as discussed in Tutorial 2, with two lines of
code:</FONT></P>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">CStatic *cs;	</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">...	</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">cs = new CStatic();	</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">cs-&gt;Create(&quot;hello world&quot;,		</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">	WS_CHILD|WS_VISIBLE|SS_CENTER,		</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">	CRect(50,80, 150, 150),		</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">	this);</FONT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">This two-line creation style is typical
of all controls created using MFC. The call to <B>new</B> allocates
memory for an instance of the <B>CStatic</B> class and, in the
process, calls the constructor for the class. The constructor
performs any initialization needed by the class. The <B>Create</B>
function creates the control at the Windows level and puts it
on the screen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The <B>Create</B> function accepts up to
five parameters, as described in the MFC help file. Choose the
<B>Search</B> option in the <B>Help</B> menu of Visual C++ and
then enter <B>Create</B> so that you can select <B>CStatic::Create</B>
from the list. Alternatively, enter <B>CStatic</B> in the search
dialog and then click the <B>Members</B> button on its overview
page.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Most of these values are self-explanatory.
The <B>lpszText</B> parameter specifies the text displayed by
the label. The <B>rect</B> parameter controls the position, size,
and shape of the text when it's displayed in its parent window.
The upper left corner of the text is determined by the upper left
corner of the <B>rect</B> parameter and its bounding rectangle
is determined by the width and height of the rect parameter. The
<B>pParentWnd</B> parameter indicates the parent of the <B>CStatic</B>
control. The control will appear in the parent window, and the
position of the control will be relative to the upper left corner
of the client area of the parent. The <B>nID</B> parameter is
an integer value used as a control ID by certain functions in
the API. We'll see examples of this parameter in the next tutorial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The <B>dwStyle</B> parameter is the most
important parameter. It controls the appearance and behavior of
the control. The following sections describe this parameter in
detail.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">CStatic Styles</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">All controls have a variety of display <I>styles</I>.
Styles are determined at creation using the <B>dwStyle</B> parameter
passed to the <B>Create</B> function. The style parameter is a
bit mask that you build by or-ing together different mask constants.
The constants available to a <B>CStatic</B> control can be found
in the MFC help file (Find the page for the <B>CStatic::Create</B>
function as described in the previous section, and click on the
<B>Static Control Styles</B> link near the top of the page) and
are also briefly described below:</FONT></P>

<H5><FONT FACE="arial">Valid styles for the CStatic class -</FONT></H5>

<H6><FONT FACE="arial">Styles inherited from CWnd:</FONT></H6>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">WS_CHILD Mandatory for CStatic.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">WS_VISIBLE The control should be visible
  to the user.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">WS_DISABLED The control should reject
  user events.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">WS_BORDER The control's text is framed

<H6><FONT FACE="arial">Styles native to CStatic:</FONT></H6>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_BLACKFRAME The control displays itself

  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_BLACKRECT The control displays itself

  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_CENTER The text is center justified.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_GRAYFRAME The control displays itself
  as a rectangular border. Color is the same as the desktop.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_GRAYRECT The control displays itself
  as a filled rectangle. Color is the same as the desktop.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_ICON The control displays itself as
  an icon. The text string is used as the name of the icon in a
  resource file. The rect parameter controls only positioning.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_LEFT The text displayed is left justified.
  Extra text is word-wrapped.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_LEFTNOWORDWRAP The text is left justified,
  but extra text is clipped.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_NOPREFIX &quot;&amp;&quot; characters
  in the text string indicate accelerator prefixes unless this
  attribute is used.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_RIGHT The text displayed is right justified.
  Extra text is word-wrapped.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_SIMPLE A single line of text is displayed
  left justified. Any CTLCOLOR messages must be ignored by the
  parent.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_USERITEM User-defined item.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_WHITEFRAME The control displays itself
  as a rectangular border. Color is the same as window backgrounds.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SS_WHITERECT The control displays itself
  as a filled rectangle. Color is the same as window backgrounds.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">These constants come from two different
sources. The &quot;SS&quot; (Static Style) constants apply only
to <B>CStatic</B> controls. The &quot;WS&quot; (Window Style)
constants apply to all windows and are therefore defined in the
<B>CWnd</B> object from which <B>CStatic</B> inherits its behavior.
There are many other &quot;WS&quot; style constants defined in
<B>CWnd</B>. They can be found by looking up the <B>CWnd::Create</B>
function in the MFC documentation. The four above are the only
ones that apply to a <B>CStatic</B>object.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">A <B>CStatic</B> object will always have
at least two style constants or-ed together: WS_CHILD and WS_VISIBLE.
The control is not created unless it is the child of another window,
and it will be invisible unless WS_VISIBLE is specified. WS_DISABLED
controls the label's response to events and, since a label has
no sensitivity to events such as keystrokes or mouse clicks anyway,
specifically disabling it is redundant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">All the other style attributes are optional
and control the appearance of the label. By modifying the style
attributes passed to the <B>CStatic::Create</B> function, you
control how the static object appears on screen. You can learn
quite a bit about the different styles by using style attributes
to modify the text appearance of the <B>CStatic</B> object, as
discussed in the next section.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">CStatic Text Appearance</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The code shown below is useful for understanding
the behavior of the <B>CStatic</B> object. It is similar to the
listing discussed in Tutorial 2, but it modifies the creation
of the <B>CStatic </B>object slightly. Please turn to Tutorial
1 for instructions on entering and compiling this code.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The function first calls the <B>CTestWindow::Create</B>
function for the window at line 1. This is the <B>Create</B> function
for the <B>CFrameWnd</B> object, since <B>CTestWindow</B> inherits
its behavior from <B>CFrameWnd</B>. The code in line 1 specifies
that the window should have a size of 200 by 200 pixels and that
the upper left corner of the window should be initially placed
at location 0,0 on the screen. The constant <B>rectDefault</B>
can replace the <B>CRect</B> parameter if desired.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">At line 2, the code calls <B>CTestWindow::GetClientRect</B>,
passing it the parameter <B>&amp;r</B>. The <B>GetClientRect</B>
function is inherited from the <B>CWnd</B> class (see the side-bar
for search strategies to use when trying to look up functions
in the Microsoft documentation). The variable <B>r</B> is of type
<B>CRect </B>and is declared as a local variable at the beginning
of the function.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Two questions arise here in trying to understand
this code: 1) What does the <B>GetClientRect</B> function do?
and 2) What does a <B>CRect</B> variable do? Let's start with
question 1. When you look up the <B>CWnd::GetClientRect</B> function
in the MFC documentation you find it returns a structure of type
<B>CRect </B>that contains the size of the client rectangle of
the particular window. It stores the structure at the address
passed in as a parameter, in this case <B>&amp;r</B>. That address
should point to a location of type <B>CRect</B>. The <B>CRect</B>
type is a class defined in MFC. It is a convenience class used
to manage rectangles. If you look up the class in the MFC documentation,
you will find that it defines over 30 member functions and operators
to manipulate rectangles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In our case, we want to center the words
&quot;Hello World&quot; in the window. Therefore, we use <B>GetClientRect</B>
to get the rectangle coordinates for the client area. In line
3 we then call <B>CRect::InflateRect</B>, which symmetrically
increases or decreases the size of a rectangle (see also CRect::DeflateRect).
Here we have decreased the rectangle by 20 pixels on all sides.
Had we not, the border surrounding the label would have blended
into the window frame, and we would not be able to see it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The actual <B>CStatic</B> label is created
in lines 4 and 5. The style attributes specify that the words
displayed by the label should be centered and surrounded by a
border. The size and position of the border is determined by the
<B>CRect</B> parameter <B>r </B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">By modifying the different style attributes
you can gain an understanding of the different capabilities of
the <B>CStatic</B> Object. For example, the code below contains
a replacement for the <B>CTestWindow </B>constructor function
in the first listing.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080" FACE="arial">}</FONT></PRE>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The code above is identical to the previous
except the text string is much longer. As you can see when you
run the code, the <B>CStatic </B>object has wrapped the text within
the specified bounding rectangle and centered each line individually.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">If the bounding rectangle is too small to
contain all the lines of text, then the text is clipped as needed
to make it fit the available space. This feature of the <B>CStatic</B>
object can be demonstrated by decreasing the size of the rectangle
or increasing the length of the string.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In all the code we have seen so far, the
style SS_CENTER has been used to center the text. The <B>CStatic</B>
object also allows for left or right justification. Left justification
is created by replacing the SS_CENTER attribute with an SS_LEFT
attribute. Right justification aligns the words to the right margin
rather than the left and is specified with the SS_RIGHT attribute.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">One other text attribute is available. It
turns off the word wrap feature and is used often for simple labels
that identify other controls (see figure 3.1 for an example).
The SS_LEFTNOWORDWRAP style forces left justification and causes
no wrapping to take place.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Rectangular Display Modes for CStatic</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The <B>CStatic</B> object also supports
two different rectangular display modes: solid filled rectangles
and frames. You normally use these two styles to visually group
other controls within a window. For example, you might place a
black rectangular frame in a window to collect together several
related editable areas. You can choose from six different styles
when creating these rectangles: SS_BLACKFRAME, SS_BLACKRECT, SS_GRAYFRAME,
SS_GRAYRECT, SS_WHITEFRAME, and SS_WHITERECT. The RECT form is
a filled rectangle, while the FRAME form is a border. The color
names are a little misleading-for example, SS_WHITERECT displays
a rectangle of the same color as the window background. Although
this color defaults to white, the user can change it with the
Control Panel and the rectangle may not be actually white on some
machines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">When a rectangle or frame attribute is specified,
the <B>CStatic </B>'s text string is ignored. Typically an empty
string is passed. Try using several of these styles in the previous
code and observe the result.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Fonts</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You can change the font of a <B>CStatic</B>
object by creating a <B>CFont</B> object. Doing so demonstrates
how one MFC class can interact with another in certain cases to
modify behavior of a control. The <B>CFont</B> class in MFC holds
a single instance of a particular Windows font. For example, one
instance of the <B>CFont</B> class might hold a Times font at
18 points while another might hold a Courier font at 10 points.
You can modify the font used by a static label by calling the
<B>SetFont</B> function that <B>CStatic</B> inherits from <B>CWnd</B>.
The code below shows the code required to implement fonts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The code above starts by creating the window
and the <B>CStatic </B>object as usual. The code then creates
an object of type <B>CFont</B>. The font variable should be declared
as a data member in the <B>CTestWindow</B> class with the line
&quot;CFont *font&quot;. The <B>CFont::CreateFont</B> function
has 15 parameters (see the MFC help file), but only three matter
in most cases. For example, the 36 specifies the size of the font
in points, the 700 specifies the density of the font (400 is &quot;normal,&quot;
700 is &quot;bold,&quot; and values can range from 1 to 1000.
The constants FW_NORMAL and FW_BOLD have the same meanings. See
the FW constants in the API help file), and the word &quot;arial&quot;
names the font to use. Windows typically ships with five True
Type fonts (Arial, Courier New, Symbol, Times New Roman, and Wingdings),
and by sticking to one of these you can be fairly certain that
the font will exist on just about any machine. If you specify
a font name that is unknown to the system, then the <B>CFont</B>
class will choose the default font seen in all the other examples
used in this tutorial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">For more information on the <B>CFont</B>
class see the MFC documentation. There is also a good overview
on fonts in the API on-line help file. Search for &quot;Fonts
and Text Overview.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The <B>SetFont</B> function comes from the
<B>CWnd</B> class. It sets the font of a window, in this case
the <B>CStatic</B> child window. One question you may have at
this point is, &quot;How do I know which functions available in
<B>CWnd</B> apply to the <B>CStatic</B> class?&quot; You learn
this by experience. Take half an hour one day and read through
all the functions in <B>CWnd </B>. You will learn quite a bit
and you should find many functions that allow you to customize
controls. We will see other <B>Set </B>functions found in the
<B>CWnd</B> class in the next tutorial.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In this tutorial we looked at the many different
capabilities of the <B>CStatic</B> object. We left out some of
the <B>Set</B> functions inherited from the <B>CWnd</B> class
so they can be discussed in Tutorial 4 where they are more appropriate.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Looking up functions in the Microsoft Documentation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In Visual C++ Version 5.x, looking up functions
that you are unfamiliar with is very simple. All of the MFC, SDK,
Windows API, and C/C++ standard library functions have all been
integrated into the same help system. If you are uncertain of
where a function is defined or what syntax it uses, just use the
<B>Search</B> option in the Help menu. All occurrences of the
function are returned and you may look through them to select
the help for the specific function that you desire.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Compiling multiple executables</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">This tutorial contains several different
example programs. There are two different ways for you to compile
and run them. The first way is to place each different program
into its own directory and then create a new project for each
one. Using this technique, you can compile each program separately
and work with each executeable simultaneously or independently.
The disadvantage of this approach is the amount of disk space
it consumes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The second approach involves creating a
single directory that contains all of the executables from this
tutorial. You then create a single project file in that directory.
To compile each program, you can edit the project and change its
source file. When you rebuild the project, the new executable
reflects the source file that you chose. This arrangement minimizes
disk consumption, and is generally preferred. <BR>
