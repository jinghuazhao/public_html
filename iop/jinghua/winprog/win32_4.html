<!-- Force all text to format --><FONT FACE="arial">One of the
most fascinating parts of Windows NT is its security system. It
is possible to almost completely ignore this part of the Win32
API if you don't care to secure things. However, there are many
situations where the security features built into NT can help
to solve some very interesting problems. In this article you will
learn about the intent of the NT's security system, the concepts
that help you to understand what is going on, and the techniques
used to manipulate it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Please note that some of the code in this
chapter will not work as described unless you log in as the administrator.
Only administrators have the rights necessary to perform some
of the system security tasks demonstrated here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">THE POSSIBILITIES</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Most people have never seen or worked with
a security system as complete and intricate as NT's. Experienced
UNIX programmers are familiar with UNIX's file security system
and with the idea of root privileges, but these systems are primitive
compared to NT's. The following examples give you some feeling
for the scope and preciseness of NT's security system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">People using the NT File System can see
the security features built into it because of the Security menu
and security editor in the File Manager. You can write your own
code that modifies the security information in an NT File System
volume at that same level of detail. From programs that you write,
you can control who has what type of access to any file on an
NTFS volume, just like the File Manager does.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can create a named pipe server on
  one system that, for example, only administrators on other systems
  can access. When people try to connect to the server, the security
  system will check to make sure they have the proper access authority
  and reject users who do not have administrative privileges. You
  might do this so that administrators on different machines can
  send information to one another in a way that guarantees authenticity.
  You can write code so that it selectively allows or denies access
  to any user or group of users, or to all users.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can create a mutex with security attributes
  that allow only certain users or groups to access it. This capability
  applies to any object in the system: files, semaphores, threads,
  events, shared memory in file mappings, etc. In the case of a
  mutex, you can use this facility to guard against unauthorized
  access to the synchronization mechanism of an application.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can give any object (for example,
  a thread, mutex, pipe, file or registry key) the ability to create
  an entry in the event log whenever it is accessed. You can specify
  individual types of access, and individual users, that generate
  an event log entry. For example, you can cause a specific file
  to generate an event log entry whenever the user smith successfully
  reads that file.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The above examples show that NT allows you
to give precise security access to specific objects in the system,
and it also allows you to monitor and record how objects are used.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">UNDERSTANDING THE TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS
OF THE NT SECURITY SYSTEM</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">One of the most interesting and frustrating
parts of the NT security system is the huge number of new concepts
that it contains, along with the vocabulary that describes these
concepts. The goal of this section is to put those concepts into
simple terms so that you can understand them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">By now you are already familiar with the
most visible part of the security system: passwords. You can think
of the password system as the lock on the front door of a building.
The password system keeps people out of an NT system just like
a lock on a building keeps people from wandering around in the
lobby. Your password gives you a key to the building that is an
NT system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">If one of your hard disks is formatted with
the NT File System, then you know that there is a second layer
of security in NT as well. You can think of this second layer
as locks on individual rooms inside of the building. Some rooms
are wide open and anyone can walk in, while others have locks
on them. The locks on an individual room can be very specific
in NT. For example, you can create a file on a volume formatted
with the NT File System and you can let any combination of people
access it:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can let no one but the owner access
  it</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can let only a single user access
  it</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can let several individual users access
  it</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can name an NT group and let any member
  of that group access it</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can name an NT group and let any member
  of that group access it, but then specifically deny access to
  individual members of the group</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can name multiple groups that can
  access it</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">You can let anyone access it</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Think of a secured file as a room. The security
permissions that you put on the file are like a lock that determines
who is allowed into the room. You can also control what a person
is allowed to do once they get into a room. For example, with
a file you can give one user read access, another user write access,
and so on. See the Permissions dialog in the Security menu of
the File Manager for examples.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Think of NT as a building full of rooms.
Your password gives you a key that lets you into the building.
Once inside, you can then use your key to enter individual rooms.
Some rooms have no locks, while other are locked and will let
you in, and still others will refuse you entry. The rooms are
individual objects in the NT system: files, registry keys, thread
and mutex objects, etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You can also put a sentry at the door of
any of the rooms. The sentry's job is to monitor who uses the
room, and how they use it. This is called auditing in NT. When
you attach an auditing request to an NT object, the object writes
entries in the security portion of the event log whenever certain
users access the object in specified ways. For example, if you
have access to an NT file system volume and have administrative
privileges, open the File Manager and select a file that you own.
Then select the Auditing option in the Security menu. For any
individual user or group, you can detect when they successfully
or unsuccessfully (or both) read the file, write to the file,
execute the file, and so on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The most obvious place to see these security
features is in the NT File System. The security editor in the
File Manager lets you easily and graphically manipulate all of
the different security features available for files. This same
level of security detail applies to many different objects in
NT. For example, you can secure items in the Registry with this
level of detail, and in fact the registry editor contains the
same sort of visual security editor that the File Manager contains.
You can also specify security attributes on many internal system
objects. For example, you can limit access to a named pipe (see
Section 10.9) in this way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Here is a brief summary of the concepts
discussed above:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">An NT system is like a building. Your
  password gives you a key into the building.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Once you are inside you find potentially
  thousands of rooms. A file is like a room, and so is a registry
  entry, a named pipe, a thread, and so on.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Each room can be secured by its owner
  with a lock that is keyed for user and group IDs. That is, the
  owner of the room can let just one person use the room, or a
  collection of users and groups, or everyone.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Each room can also be manned with a sentry
  who detects and records who enters the room and what each person
  does once they are inside.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now that you understand the general concepts,
let's look at some of NT's specific vocabulary for discussing
security.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">NT SECURITY VOCABULARY</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">When you log into an NT system, the system
gives you an access token. The access token is your key to all
of the locks found in an NT system. Your key will turn some locks,
but it will not work in all of them. Each process that you create
contains a copy of your access token.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The access token does two different things.
First, it identifies who you are. For example, if you logged in
as the user &quot;smith&quot;, then your access token contains
your identity as that user. The access token also identifies you
by all of the groups you belong to. For example, in the User Manager
you may be a member of the Power User group, the Backup Operator
group, and a custom group named Programmers. Your access token
identifies you as a member of these different groups.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Your access token also contains all of your
user rights. Each group you belong can have user rights, or privileges,
associated with it. If you open the User Manager you can look
at the list of rights with the User Rights menu option. For example,
power users have the right to set the system time, while normal
users do not. Some users can shut down the system while others
cannot, and so on. The system builds up the list of rights in
your access token by combining all of the individual rights found
in each group you belong to. Individual users can also have special
rights granted to them specifically by the administrator with
the User Manager.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><IMG SRC="token.gif"
WIDTH="384" HEIGHT="216" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<ADDRESS><FONT FACE="arial">An access token contains a user ID,
the names of the groups the user belongs to, and the combined
user rights from all of those groups</FONT></ADDRESS>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Most of the objects in the system can have
locks on them. In NT, a lock is called a security descriptor.
If the Create function for an object contains a security parameter,
you can lock it. The following objects can have locks:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Files (if they exist on an NT File System
    volume)</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Directories (if they exist on an NT File
    System volume)</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Registry keys</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Processes</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Threads</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Mutexes</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Semaphores</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Events</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Named Pipes (on the system and over the
    network)</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Anonymous Pipes (on the system only)</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Mailslots (on the system only)</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Console screen buffers</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">File mappings</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Services</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Private objects</FONT>
  </UL>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To lock an object, you create a security
descriptor and pass it to the object when you create it. In all
of the previous sections in this book, the example code has passed
a zero in for the security attributes parameter. The zero indicates
to the system that it should create a default security descriptor
that allows you to access the object. See the book for a description
of default security descriptors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">A security descriptor contains four things:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">An owner identifier that identifies the
  current owner of the object</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">A primary group identifier</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">A system access control list, or SACL,
  that contains auditing information</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">A discretionary access control list, or
  DACL, that determines which users and groups can and cannot access
  the object.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The owner of an NT object can always set
its security information. For example, if you own a file and accidentally
set it so that no one can access it, you can still go back and
change its security because you are the owner. It is like breaking
the lock to your house: Even though the lock is broken, you can
always replace it with a new one because you own the house.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><IMG SRC="sd.gif" WIDTH="264"
HEIGHT="240" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<ADDRESS><FONT FACE="arial">The security descriptor for any object
contains the owner and group IDs, the discretionary access control
list that determines who can and cannot access the object, and
the system access control list that controls who gets audited
when they use the object</FONT></ADDRESS>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The DACL (Discretionary Access Control List)
is the heart of the actual lock. It controls who can and cannot
access the object. It is an access control list, or ACL, that
contains access control entries, or ACEs. Each ACE indicates one
user or group, along with what they can or cannot do to the object.
For example, if the object is a file and the user &quot;smith&quot;
is allowed to read from the file, then there will be an ACE that
indicates that user &quot;smith&quot; has read access. This is
called an access allowed ACE because it allows a user or group
to do something. There is one access allowed ace for each person
or group allowed to access the object. Similarly, there are access
denied ACEs which deny specific users or groups access. For example,
if you have given the group Power Users access to an object, but
&quot;smith&quot; is a power user and you don't want him to have
access, an access denied ACE keeps him out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The SACL (System Access Control List) also
contains ACEs, but these ACEs determine who will be audited and
why. An ACE in a SACL is called an audit access ACE. For example,
if the system is supposed to create an audit entry whenever the
user &quot;smith&quot; successfully reads a file, one ACE in the
SACL states that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><IMG SRC="ace.gif" WIDTH="384"
HEIGHT="144" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<ADDRESS><FONT FACE="arial">An Access Control Entry (ACE) specifies
one user or group (the SID identifies the user or group) and the
type of access allowed. ACEs are stored in ACLs (see Figure 10.3).</FONT></ADDRESS>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To convey its information, each ACE in an
ACL consists of three parts: a Security Identifier, or SID, an
access mask, and an ACE header. The SID is a value stored in the
registry (and also available through function calls) that uniquely
identifies each user or group that exists in the User Manager.
The ACE header determines the type of ACE: access allowed, access
denied, etc. An access mask is a 32-bit mask that determines what
the user can do with the object. There are standard rights that
apply to all objects on the system. Some objects also have a variety
of special access rights that apply only to them. For example,
you can apply the following specific and standard access rights
to a file object:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The generic rights are pre-defined combinations
of standard and specific rights and change from object to object.
See Section 10.5 for more information on these securable objects
and their access rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">An access mask is simply a 32-bit bit-mask.
Each of the standard, specific and generic rights have a bit associated
with them in the access mask. The first 16 bits hold specific
rights and are keyed to the object that the access mask refers
to (for example, the FILE_ constants above). The next 8 bits hold
standard rights. The high-order four bits hold generic rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">As you can see, there is a whole cornucopia
of new terminology used to describe NT's security features. However,
you will become intimately familiar with all of these words as
you work through the sample code, and all of the concepts are
easy to understand. Here is a quick summary:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">When users log in, they receive access
  tokens. An access token contains the user's ID, the user's groups,
  and the user's privileges culled from the groups.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Each object has a security descriptor
  that acts as its lock. A security descriptor contains an owner
  and group identifier, a System ACL, and a Discretionary ACL.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">A DACL controls who is allowed to do what
  to the object</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">A SACL controls who is audited for doing
  what to an object</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">ACLs consist of ACEs. Each ACE contains
  a SID that identifies the user or group, an access mask that
  determines the actions allowed to the user or group, and an ACE
  header that determines the type of ACE.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The following section presents two simple
example to show how the security functions and all of this vocabulary
fit together.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">SIMPLE EXAMPLES</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The purpose of this section is to walk through
the creation and application of a security descriptor for a file
object. A file object is chosen for this example because it is
common and easily understood, and also because it is easy to view
the results with the security editor in the File Manager to prove
that the code works. However, if your hard disk is not formatted
with the NT File System, this code will not do anything and the
security editor is disabled. You have three options if this is
the case:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<OL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Reformat your hard disk with NTFS and
  reload NT, or use the <B>convert</B> command to convert your
  hard disk to the NT file system.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Install a new hard disk and format it
  with the NT File System</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Partition off a small section (say 10
  megabytes) of your existing hard disk and format it with NTFS.
  This means that you will have to reformat and reload the original
  partition as well</FONT>
</OL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Alternatively, you can wait a moment and
we will apply this same code to a registry key. You will be able
to see the security editor in the registry editor regardless of
the file system that you are using.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The code below contains a program that creates
a new file. The security descriptor for the new file is set up
so that only the user &quot;guest&quot; can use the file, and
the user can do nothing but read it. The program contains absolutely
no error checking so that the essentials are easy to see. When
you run the code, it should create a file on <B>c:\</B> named
<B>testfile</B>. Select the file in the File Manager and then
choose the Permissions option in the Security menu. You will find
that there is one entry in the list: The user &quot;guest&quot;
can read the file. Feel free to change the name of the file or
the name of the user when you run the code yourself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Start by looking at the bottom of the program.
Here you will find a call to CreateFile that creates a file named
c:\testfile. However, this call has a security parameter at location
four in the parameter list. In all NT code you have probably seen,
you have seen a zero used in this location. The zero tells the
operating system to use a default security descriptor when it
creates the object (see Section 10.8 of the book). The zero value
also disables inheritance (see Chapter 5). This code code instead
creates a SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure that contains a valid
security descriptor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The creation of a security descriptor starts
with a call to the InitializeSecurityDescriptor function seen
at the first line of the listing. <I>[See the Win32 help file
in the SDK or Visual C++ help files for more information on this
and the following functions.]</I> This step creates a security
descriptor in absolute format (there is also a second format called
the self-relative format, and the differences are described in
Section 10.6 of the book). The new security descriptor initially
contains no information besides the revision level: no owner identifier,
no group identifier, no SACL, and no DACL.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The next line calls InitializeAcl to create
the ACL that will become the DACL for the security descriptor.
When the InitializeAcl function returns, pacl points to an empty
ACL. That is, the ACL contains no ACEs. If you were to comment
out the next two lines so that this empty ACL was placed into
the security descriptor, and that security descriptor was applied
to the file, then no one would be able to access the file. In
the absence of any ACEs in the discretionary ACL, no one has access.
Alternatively, if you were to create no DACL at all and pass NULL
in during the DACL installation step below, then everyone could
access the file.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The next two lines create an ACE and add
it to the ACL. The LookupAccountName function returns a SID for
the specified account name. The LookupAccountName function looks
up the account name specified on the system specified or on the
local system. If it is not found locally the function looks on
the domain controller or trusted domain controllers if appropriate.
The function returns a SID for the account, the domain where it
was found if the SID came from a domain controller, and an enumerated
value that indicates the type of account:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SidTypeUser</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SidTypeGroup</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SidTypeDomain</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SidTypeAlias</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SidTypeWellKnownGroup</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SidTypeDeletedAccount</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SidTypeInvalid</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">SidTypeUnknown</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">A SID is a security identifier. It uniquely
identifies a user or a group to the system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The SID returned by the LookupAccountName
function is used in a call to the AddAccessAllowedAce function
to create an access allowed (as opposed to access denied) ACE
and add it to the currently-empty ACL.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The AddAccessAllowedAce function creates
the ACE with the SID and access mask specified and adds it to
the ACL specified. The GENERIC_READ access mask grants read access
to the file and its attributes. See Section 10.5 for a list of
the specific and standard rights that GENERIC_READ adds to the
access mask.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now the code in the listing has an ACL containing
one ACE that specifies that the user &quot;guest&quot; should
have read access. This ACL needs to be placed into the Discretionary
ACL of the security descriptor using the SetSecurityDescriptorDacl
function.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now the security descriptor contains a valid
DACL with one ACE in it. The code places this security descriptor
in a security attributes structure and then passes it to the CreateFile
function (see Chapter 2).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">If you were to comment out the previous
three lines in the code, and replace pacl with NULL for the DACL
in the call to SetSecurityDescriptorDacl, everyone would have
access to the file. The absence of a DACL implies that everyone
should be able to access the file.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Compile and run the code. Make sure that
the file name specified in the program does not already exist
when you run it. When you look at the new file with the File Manager's
security editor, you will find that its permissions are set as
specified in the code.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You can easily modify the code to experiment
with security descriptors. For example, try giving write access
to a certain group, or add several ACEs to the DACL, or create
an access denied ACE using AddAccessDeniedAce. Be sure that access
denied ACEs precede access allowed ACEs. Use the SetSecurityDescriptorOwner
function to modify the owner in the security descriptor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Another Example</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">This exact same security descriptor code
can be applied to any other securable NT object, because the security
system is uniform across all objects. For example, you can use
it to create a key in the registry, as demonstrated in the code
below. See Chapter 15 for information on the registry and registry
keys. If you compare this listing with the previous, you will
find that they are exactly the same except that this listing uses
RegCreateKeyEx to create a registry key instead of a file.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Before running this code, run the registry
editor (regedt32.exe) and look at the HKEY_CURRENT_USER window
to make sure HKEY_CURRENT_USER does not already contain a key
named &quot;junk&quot;. If it does, delete it, or modify the code
to create a different key. Now run the code. Refresh the registry
editor display if it is not set to automatically refresh, and
you will see a new key named &quot;junk&quot;. When you check
its permissions using the Permissions option in the Security menu,
you will find that you or &quot;administrator&quot; owns the key
and that &quot;guest&quot; is the only user who has access to
it. Change the name of the key or the user as you desire. Since
the code in creates a volatile key (see Chapter 15), the key will
disappear when you log off or reboot the system.</FONT>
