<!-- Force all text to format --><FONT FACE="arial">Threads are
one of the most exciting and useful features in Windows NT/95
and the Win32 API. Threads let you break up a single program into
multiple threads of execution. In this article you will learn
the basic concepts used to create threads in any Win32 program.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">The Possibilities</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">There are a number of ways that you might
use threads in your own programs. Here are some ideas:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">If you create an MDI (Multiple Document
  Interface) application, it is often useful to assign a separate
  thread to each window. For example, in an MDI communications
  program that lets you connect to multiple hosts via multiple
  modems simultaneously, it simplifies things considerably if each
  window has its own thread that communicates with just one host.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">In a program that takes a long time to
  refresh its display because of the complexity of the graphics
  involved (for example, a CAD/CAM program may have to draw 10,000
  line segments to refresh the display in a complicated drawing),
  it is useful to create a separate thread to handle the redrawing.
  The user interface, with its own thread, remains active for the
  user while the redrawing takes place in the background.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">In a complicated simulation program, for
  example a program that simulates the activity of organisms in
  an environment, the design of the program is often conceptually
  simpler if each entity has its own thread. The entities are then
  fully independent of one another and can respond to their own
  simulation events individually.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">If you have part of a program that needs
  to respond to certain high-priority events very quickly, the
  problem is easily solved using thread priorities. The high-priority
  portion of the code is placed in its own thread, and that thread
  is given a higher priority than other threads running on the
  machine. The high- priority thread then waits for the necessary
  events. When it senses one, it will awaken and receive almost
  all of the CPU cycles available until it completes its task.
  It can then go back to sleep waiting for the next event to arrive.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">If you are using a machine with multiple
  processors and you want to take full advantage of all of the
  CPU power available, then you need to break the application into
  multiple threads. NT's unit of division across CPUs is the thread,
  so if you have an application that contains only one thread it
  will, by default, use only one CPU out of those available. If
  the program breaks up its work into multiple threads, however,
  NT can run each thread on a different CPU.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="arial">Any task that needs to happen &quot;in
  the background&quot; while the user continues to work with the
  application is easily handled with threads. For example, you
  might place lengthy recalculations, page formatting operations,
  file reading and writing, etc. in separate threads that let the
  activities proceed in the background without disturbing the user.</FONT>
</UL>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">If you are moving to NT from UNIX, VMS,
or a mainframe, then <I>multi-processing</I> is a familiar concept.
Multi-<I>threading</I> may be new to you however. If you are moving
from MS-DOS, then both multi-processing and multi-threading are
probably new to you. Let's start by looking at what multi- processing
and multi-threading actually mean from an operating system standpoint.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The MS-DOS operating system is a single-process
operating system. It can run one program at a time. You load a
program, work with it, quit it, and then run another. TSRs can,
in certain situations, give an impression of multi-processing,
but the problems that TSRs normally cause show that they are at
best an illusion that MS-DOS was never intended to support.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Microsoft Windows 3.1, as well as Apple's
Macintosh system, are cooperative multi-tasking operating environments.
Both can run multiple programs (processes), at the same time.
For example, you can run a word processor in one window, a spreadsheet
in another window, and download a file from a BBS in a third window.
The word cooperative is used because it is up to each program
to properly relinquish control at appropriate times so that all
of the processes appear to be working simultaneously. Cooperative
multi-tasking works to some degree. However, a lengthy disk access
or other undividable task performed by one program will tend to
monopolize the entire system for a moment and the cooperation
breaks down. This makes cooperative multi-tasking systems seem
jerky in many cases. If one program locks up, the whole system
often dies with it. As soon as one program locks, it cannot relinquish
control to the others and everything stops.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">UNIX is a preemptive multi-tasking operating
system. The operating system, rather than individual applications,
is in charge of giving CPU time to all of the running processes
and it does so as it best sees fit. UNIX gives a process a time
slice of CPU time--perhaps 20 milliseconds or so--and when that
amount of time expires the operating preempts the process and
gives the next slice of CPU time to another process. A UNIX machine
can therefore have literally hundreds of processes running at
one time and still feel very smooth to the user. If one process
locks it has no effect on the others because the operating system
is still in control of slicing up the CPU time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Windows NT (and Windows 95) is a preemptively
multi-tasking, multi-threaded operating system. Because it uses
preemptive multi-tasking, it shares with UNIX the same smoothness
of operation and process independence. Multi-threading goes one
step further however. An individual program by default contains
one thread, but it can break itself into several independent threads
of execution so that, for example, one thread of an application
can send a file to the printer while another is responding to
user input. This simple change in the a program's design can significantly
reduce any waiting that the user normally has to worry about during
lengthy recalculations, screen painting, file reading and writing,
etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Multi-threading also lets you take advantage
of multiple CPUs available in many high-end NT machines. Say,
for example, that you purchase an advanced RISC machine capable
of using up to 10 CPU chips, but initially you purchase only one
CPU for it. As part of your learning cycle you write a simple
Mandelbrot set program, and you find that for a window of a certain
size it takes 15 seconds to redraw the image of the Mandelbrot
set.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now you add nine more CPU chips to the machine.
When you rerun the Mandelbrot program, you will find that it still
takes almost 15 seconds to execute. NT has the ability to run
different threads on different CPUs, but it cannot do anything
with a single threaded program but devote one CPU to it. There
is no way for NT to divide a single thread across CPUs. Since
NT is itself multi-threaded, the Mandelbrot program will speed
up slightly because it is not competing with NT's system threads
for CPU time. However, any one program cannot harness more than
one tenth of the CPU power in a 10-CPU machine unless it is multi-threaded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">If you multi-thread your Mandelbrot program,
NT can run the separate threads on separate CPUs, and this allows
it to take full advantage of all of the available CPU power. For
example, if the Mandelbrot program breaks itself into 10 threads,
then one thread will run on each CPU and the program will run
ten times faster. There is no reason to use more than ten threads
on a 10-CPU machine, because each thread incurs a very slight
amount of overhead and it is therefore wasteful to have more than
10. However, you could break the program into 100 threads if you
like, or use one thread for each scan-line of the drawing, if
that makes things conceptually easier for you in a certain application.
There are many cases where breaking an application into multiple
threads actually makes the whole program much easier to understand,
and threads turn out to be remarkably easy to create.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Processes in NT are not nearly as interesting
as threads. A program can create a separate process, but the new
process is completely and totally separate from the original program.
Unlike UNIX, where a new process obtains a complete copy of the
variable space of the original process, a new process in NT can
at most inherit copies of specifically indicated handles. Generally
you use a process when you want to start another independent program
from within a running program. For example, if you wanted to write
your own version of the Program Manager or File Manager, you would
use processes to launch other applications from your program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">When any process starts in NT, it by default
contains one thread of execution. For example, when you type &quot;notepad&quot;
on the command line or double click on notepad's icon in the Program
Manager, NT creates a process, and that process has one thread
that &quot;runs&quot; notepad's code. The process is essentially
a container for the global variables, environment strings, the
heap owned by the application, and the thread. The thread is what
actually executes the code.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">All threads in one process share the variable
space of their parent process. Each thread also has its own stack.
When you create a new thread within a process, it has access to
all of the global variables and the heap of the parent process.
All of the problems that arise from the careless use of globals
in a normal program are therefore compounded in a multi-threaded
program, because now several different threads can modify the
same global variables independently of one another. To solve the
problems that tend to arise in such situations, there are synchronization
mechanisms built in to the Win32 API that help you to guarantee
exclusive access to global values.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Simple Example 1</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">For many people, the whole idea of creating
multiple threads within a single process requires some mental
adjustment. Let's start by looking at several extremely simple
examples to see how threads fundamentally work in the Win32 API.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The code below contains an extremely simple
single-thread program. In this program, the code prints the value
of the global variable named count each time the user presses
the return key. Nothing in the program changes count, so the program
always prints 0. There is no magic here:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Now let's add a thread to the code, as shown
below. A thread in NT is simply a function that executes in the
background. The function CountThread in the code below increments
the global variable named count and then sleeps for 100 milliseconds.
When you run the program, you will find that each time you press
the enter key, count has increased. The thread runs in the background
incrementing count, while the original thread is responding to
user input. The program is doing two things at once.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The arrangement of the main thread, the
counting thread, and the global variable in the previous listing
is shown below:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><IMG SRC="thread.gif" WIDTH="337" HEIGHT="235"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The code starts by creating the thread using
the CreateThread function (see the Win32 on-line help files in
VC++ version 2.0 or the NT SDK for a description of this function).
The CreateThread function accepts the name of the <I>thread function</I>,
the function to execute in the new thread. Here, the thread function
is CountThread. The thread function can optionally accept one
four-byte parameter. In the listing above the thread function
uses no parameters, but if it did the parameter that the thread
function receives is passed to CreateThread in the param parameter,
and CreateThread in turn passes it on to the thread function.
CreateThread returns both a thread ID and a handle to the thread.
The thread ID is used to uniquely identify the thread system-wide,
and is also accepted by a few functions such as AttachThreadInput.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You can control the initial size of the
thread's stack using the stack parameter. Setting stack parameter
to 0 causes the thread to start with a stack of the same size
as its parent thread. The stack will grow as necessary, but growth
is a wasteful activity so if you know that the thread will need
a certain amount of space in its stack because of the size of
its local variables, you should try to accommodate that from the
start. It is also possible to start a thread so that it is originally
suspended. In this case, the thread will consume no CPU time until
some other thread unsuspends it with ResumeThread.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The Sleep function in the above listing
provides an efficient way for a thread to delay itself. In a previous
life you may have used a for loop or some similar mechanism to
cause a delay, but as you know, for loops are unreliable and also
extremely wasteful. As the for loop is spinning it consumes CPU
cycles that could be put to better use. The Sleep function lets
a thread delay itself without consuming any CPU cycles. A thread
is totally suspended during a sleep.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">Note the use of the <B>volatile</B> modifier
on the count global variable. If you comment out the Sleep function
in the thread and remove the volatile modifier, count may always
be zero when you press the enter key. This phenomenon occurs because
of strange side effects resulting from compiler optimizations.
The compiler, for example, may use a register to store the count
variable in the main thread, so changes to the value by the second
thread are ignored. The volatile modifier is a way of telling
the compiler that you do not want any optimizations applied to
the variable, that you do not want it placed in a register, and
that the value may change due to outside influences during evaluation.
You will find it to be a very important modifier for global variables
referenced by multiple threads.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Simple Example 2</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">The code shown below is another simple example
of a background thread running separately from the main thread.
This thread beeps in the background while the main thread waits
for it to finish. The code shows how to pass an integer parameter
to a thread, and also how to wait for a thread to complete.</FONT></P>

returns the value WAIT_TIMEOUT. In this configuration, we are
using WaitForSingleObject simply to detect whether or not the
background thread has finished.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">It is possible to pass structures into a
thread function by passing a pointer to the structure through
the parameter, as shown below. The structure should be stable.
That is, it should be a global variable, a static local variable,
or allocated from the heap. The structure should not be a local
variable of a function that might cease to exist during the run
of the thread.</FONT></P>

by the user are placed in a structure that is then passed to the

terminating before the thread has completed. Without this call,
the main function would return immediately, killing off both the
main process and the threads.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">When you run the above code, the program
asks you to enter a frequency and duration as well as the number
of beeps. You can do this three times, so you will hear beeps
from all three threads simultaneously if you set the number of
beeps for each thread high enough to cause an overlap.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In the above code, a wait function is again
used to keep the main function, and therefore the process, from
completing before all three threads have finished. The WaitForMultipleObjects
function does the same thing that WaitForSingleObject does, but
it waits for all of the specified events to occur. WaitForMultipleObjects
accepts an array of object handles, in this case handles from
the three threads.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><FONT FACE="arial">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">You can see from the examples given above
that the use of threads, at least at a simple level, is not much
more difficult than calling a normal function. The thread function
executes as you expect, but it returns immediately and executes
in the background, in parallel with the main thread of the application.</FONT>
