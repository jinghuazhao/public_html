    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">PROGRAMS FOR LINKAGE
    AND ALLELIC ASSOCIATION</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
    There are many programs available for linkage and allelic association
    analysis, but here we concentrate on <A HREF="#anchor8130">CLUMP</A>,
    <A HREF="#anchor7668">EH</A>, <A HREF="#anchor7273">ETDT</A>,
    <A HREF="#anchor6716">TRANSMIT</A>, <A HREF="#anchor6333">FBAT</A>,
    <A HREF="#anchor5800">ASPEX</A> and <A HREF="#anchor5299">GENEHUNTER</A>,
    Note that examples given here use their simplest features. However
    they should be easily generalised to include some advanced features,
    please consult individual program documentation for more information.
    We also refer to some other programs such as GAS, EH+, SPLINK
    and LINKAGE which are not pursued here.<BR>
    By system prompt in the following we mean either MS-DOS or Unix
    shell prompt. Unix is a system that is case-sensitive so we usually
    use program name in lower rather than upper case to start programs.<BR>
<BR>
    Availability of these programs and their references are actively
    maintained by Dr Wentian Li at http://linkage.rockefeller.edu.
    EH+ and other associated programs are available from our site
    http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/IoP/Departments/PsychMed/GEpiBSt/software.stm.<BR>
<BR>
    <I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Most programs, except perhaps ASPEX
    and FBAT, are available from HGMP. A zip file containing executables
    and examples not available from the original distributors will
    be available upon request.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
    </FONT></I><B>Program for unrelated individuals: </B><A NAME="anchor8130"></A><B>CLUMP</B></P>

    <P>CLUMP is designed for comparing allele frequency differences
    between cases and controls when the maker is very highly polymorphic.
    An example input file <I><A HREF="erda.inp">erda.inp</A></I>
    is from a case-control study of bipolar affective disorder at
    marker locus ERDA1, which contains the following lines.</P>

    <PRE>8
      117    63   120    13    25    12    27    15 
       50    35    58    29    23     5    21     9 
100
11111</PRE>

    <P>The first line tells CLUMP it is a 8-allele problem. The second
    and third lines are numbers of alleles for cases and controls,
    respectively. The fourth and fifth lines are number of replicates
    needed to generate empirical p-value and peudorandom number seed,
    respectively. Given the same seed the pseudorandom number sequence
    is determined so the program guarantes to yield the same result.</P>

    <P>Now we can enter MS-DOS prompt and run CLUMP with command</P>

    <P>clump erda.inp</P>

    <P>We can also specify an output file name as the second argument.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
    <B><I>Exercise</I></B>: Consult CLUMP documentation for meaning
    of the four test statistics. The logic of CLUMP is among the
    simplest yet most important in association analysis, i.e., obtaining
    empirical p-value when asymptotic theory does not hold, try to
    reason the program output so it comes naturally to you.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
    <B>Program for unrelated individuals: </B><A NAME="anchor7668"></A><B>EH</B></P>

    <P>EH can be used to obtain haplotype frequency estimates from
    unrelated individuals when more than one loci are involved. This
    could be done either for cases and controls seperately, or for
    a combined case-control sample assuming a generalised single
    locus model.</P>

    <P>We use the three data files <I><A HREF="eh.dat">eh.dat</A></I>,<I>
    <A HREF="control.dat">control.dat</A> </I>and<I> <A HREF="case.dat">case.dat</A>
    </I>in EH documentation as our example. First let's do a marker-maker
    analysis, enter</P>

    <P>eh</P>

    <P>at system prompt and press &lt;Return&gt; after &quot;Do you
    wish to use the case-control sampling option? [N]&quot;, &quot;Enter
    name of data file [EH.DAT]&quot;, &quot;Enter name of output
    file. [EH.OUT]&quot; and examine output. For the case-control
    example answer the following questions for EH. <BR>
<BR>
    Do you wish to use the case-control sampling option? [N]<BR>
    y<BR>
    Enter name of control data file [CONTROL.DAT] &lt;Return&gt;<BR>
    Enter name of case data file [CASE.DAT] &lt;Return&gt;<BR>
    Enter name of output file. [EH.OUT] &lt;Return&gt;<BR>
    Enter gene frequency of disease allele<BR>
    0.01<BR>
    Enter penetrances for each genotype in the following order<BR>
    Genotype +/+ +/D D/D<BR>
    0 0 1<BR>
<BR>
    and check result in eh.out</P>

    <P>Alternatively these options can be put in a batch file, similar
    to that of CLUMP. For example we call our file <I>ehtest.inp</I>
    which contains the following lines:</P>

    <P>y<BR>
    control.dat<BR>
    case.dat<BR>
    eh.out<BR>
    0.01<BR>
    0 0 1<BR>
<BR>
    then the command becomes</P>

    <P>eh &lt;ehtest.inp</P>

    <P>Note when you run the batch file at the second time, additional
    line is necessary after the fourth line containing only 'y' like
    the first line, that is, to overwrite the existant <I>eh.out</I>.
    Moreover, since it would be cumbersome to prepare input data,
    and the chi-square approximation from likelihood ratio test under
    association and no association is invalid. We can turn to EH+
    and associated programs to obtain model-free statistics and their
    empirical p-values.<BR>
<BR>
    <B><I>Exercise</I></B>: Run EH in noninteractive mode using <I><A
    HREF="ehtest.inp">ehtest.inp</A></I> given above. Examine the
    program output, what's the use of haplotype frequency estimates
    ?<BR>
    </P>

    <P><B>Program for family data: </B><A NAME="anchor7273"></A><B>ETDT</B></P>

    <P>ETDT is a program used for multiallelic TDT analysis using
    logistic regression, the so-called Bradley-Terry model.</P>

    <P>We demonstrate using the ETDT documentation files <I>example.par</I>
    and <I>example.ppd</I>. The syntax is then very straightforward.</P>

    <P>etdt example</P>

    <P>This batch file does three things. First it invokes <B>ped2tdt</B>
    program to read <I>example.par</I> in LINKAGE parameter file
    format and <I>example.ppd</I> in post-MAKEPED data file format
    and extract information concerning about transmission; then it
    starts <B>calctdt</B> to build up transmission table; finally
    it runs <B>lrtdt</B> to produce log likelihood statistics. A
    fourth program, <B>mcetdt</B>, has to to be invoked separately
    to obtain empirical p-values of these statistics.</P>

    <P>For more details, please consult ETDT documentation.<BR>
<BR>
    <B><I>Exercise</I></B>: There are several methods available for
    multiallelic TDT analysis in the literature, the data are typically
    presented in terms of transmission table. Consider the following
    table for a 5-allele system, could you trick ETDT to perform
    the analysis ?<BR>

    <B>Program for family data: </B><A NAME="anchor6716"></A><B>TRANSMIT<BR>
<BR>
    </B>TRANSMIT is a program for TDT-type analysis involving multilocus
    data. Included is an example of schizophrenia and a susceptibility
    locus at 22q12, in pre-MAKEPED and post-MAKEPED files <I><A 
    HREF="catted.pre">catted.pre</A></I> and <I><A HREF="catted.ped">catted.ped</A></I>.
    They are equivalently reformatted in <I><A HREF="catted.spl">catted.spl</A></I>
    as required by both SPLINK and TRANSMIT. It was prepared by <B>ped2spl</B>
    program of SPLINK:<BR>
<BR>
    Now issue the following command at the system prompt to obtain
    result:<BR>
<BR>
    transmit -l1 &lt;catted.spl<BR>
<BR>
    or transmit -l1 &lt;catted.spl &gt;catted.out to keep output
    in file catted.out. Here -l1 tells TRANSMIT there is only one
    marker in the data. The above command should generate the following

    <P>Short for <I>f</I>amily <I>b</I>ased <I>a</I>ssociation <I>t</I>est,
    was developed by Harvard group. It incorporates ordinary TDT-type
    analysis, including TDT using sibling controls when parental
    information becomes unavailable, as well as the Rabinowitz-Laird
    method for quantitative analysis.<BR>
<BR>
    As in GENEHUNTER, a simple command '?' gives synopsis of a complete
    command list. The commands for running are comparable to ASPEX.
    File <I><A HREF="drd4.dat">drd4.dat</A></I> contains data from
    a study of DRD4 locus. It is very similar to the format used
    by program GAS, in that an extra line indicating marker names
    appears first and sexes of individuals are marked as 'm' for
    males and 'f' for females.<BR>
<BR>
    Now we start FBAT by command:<BR>
<BR>
    fbat<BR>
<BR>
    then we type two commands:<BR>
<BR>
    load drd4.dat<BR>
    fbat<BR>
<BR>
    <B><I>Exercise</I></B>: There are apparent problem with Windows
    version of FBAT, that some commands will definitely cause the
    program to crash. Since the original author doesn't provide the
    source code, we have to turn to Unix system. However it would
    be rather tedious to run the program interactively every time,
    as we may need some nonstandard use of the program. I have create
    a batch file drd4.sh for the example used here. If you have Unix
    account then do try this by yourself when needed.<BR>
<BR>
    #!/usr/local/bin/tcsh<BR>

    <I>sib_tdt</I> here.<BR>
<BR>
    ASPEX recognises syntax parsed by the widely available package
    TCL, and generate graphics commands for XMGR. To perform analysis
    we better create a command file containing the necessary settings,
    as we do here with file drd4.tcl.<BR>

    <B>Program for family data: </B><A NAME="anchor5299"></A><B>GENEHUNTER</B><BR>
<BR>
    GENEHUNTER is a popular program for linkage analysis. Version
    2.0 has commands <I>tdt</I> and <I>tdt2-tdt4</I>, to obtain TDT
    analysis for two or more markers. It doesn't correct for multiple
    tests. Here we use GENEHUNTER documentation example. To run the
    program interactively, simply type<BR>
<BR>
    gh<BR>
<BR>
    at the system prompt. This brings you into the program. Continue
    to type in the following commands:<BR>
<BR>
    load <I><A HREF="linkloci.dat">linkloci.dat</A></I><BR>
    scan <I><A HREF="linkped.pre">linkped.pre</A></I><BR>
    total stat het<BR>
    tdt linkped.pre<BR>
    tdt2<BR>
<BR>
    We can catalog the session by command <I>photo &lt;filename&gt;</I>.
    GENEHUNTER also runs in batch mode: the command then becomes
    gh &lt;command file&gt;.</P>

    <P>Note GENEHUNTER and its variations GENEHUNTER-PLUS, GENEHUNTER/IMPRINTING,
    GENEHUNTER/TWOLOCUS, Allegro all have similar command syntax
    (command reference), a simple '?' command will give you a synopsis.<BR>
